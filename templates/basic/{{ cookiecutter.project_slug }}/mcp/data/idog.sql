This method is particularly advantageous because it is relatively noninvasive and provides access to remote lesions via the blood vessels.','You will need to give a thorough history of your dog’s health, including the onset and nature of the symptoms, to the veterinarian. He or she will then perform a complete physical examination as well as a biochemistry profile, urinalysis, complete blood count, and electrolyte panel to help identify complications associated with an arteriovenous fistula. Biochemical abnormalities, for example, may suggest liver, kidney or other organ dysfunction.Because arteriovenous fistulae significantly affect the dog''s blood flow, thoracic X-rays may show enlargement of the heart and signs of over-circulation to the lungs. In addition, a Doppler ultrasound may show high-velocity, turbulent flow within the lesion.To locate the arteriovenous fistula, your veterinarian may employ an echocardiogram on the dog.

Ciclosporin (Atopica; Novartis Animal Health; cyclosporine, cyclosporin A or CsA) has been licensed for canine atopic dermatitis (AD) since 2002. ','Diagnosis of allergies is a complicated task. The investigation of a suspected allergic dog should include rigorous treatment for external parasites and secondary bacterial and yeast infections which often complicate and contribute to the itch. A diagnosis of food intolerance is made in 2-10% of ''itchy'' dogs. It can be controlled without using drugs and is worth ruling out by introducing an elimination diet followed by dietary challenge to confirm the diagnosis. Elimination diets are time consuming and require considerable owner commitment. It can be up to 3 months before the dog stops scratching. Once other causes of itch have been ruled out, specific tests to detect allergic antibodies to environmental allergens can be undertaken to confirm the diagnosis of atopy.Skin tests can be used to determine the allergens to which the animal is hypersensitive.','Dogs with atopic dermatitis usually have physical signs commonly seen in other skin diseases, such as flea bite hypersensitivity, food hypersensitivity, contact dermatitis, scabies, intestinal parasite hypersensitivity, folliculitis, pelodera dermatitis, and hookworm dermatitis.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(22,'Atopy','82','An allergy caused from things dogs inhale.','Atopy can be satisfactorily controlled in at least 90 percent of affected dogs. There are 3 components to successful treatment, which will be life-long and will likely require modification from time to time. A combination approach is generally most effective. 1 reduction in exposure to allergens. This requires identification of the substances to which your dog is sensitive (ie. allergy testing). You may be able to avoid some allergens altogether (if your dog is allergic to feathers or tobacco smoke for example), and reduce exposure to others (by keeping your pet out of carpeted areas to reduce house dust mite exposure for example). Your veterinarian will discuss this with you, in conjunction with the results of your dog''s allergy testing. 2 hyposensitization (immunotherapy or "allergy shots").   This is recommended when the allergens involved can''t be avoided, and your dog has clinical signs more than 4 to 6 months of the year which can not be kept under control with medical therapy. Immunotherapy is carried out after your dog''s allergens have been identified by allergy testing. Injections of low doses of the appropriate allergens are given at short intervals at first, and then boosters given as needed when clinical signs begin to reappear. 3 medical treatment. Long term management may include gentle moisturizing anti-pruritic (control itching) shampoos, fatty acids, antihistamines (more likely effective when given as preventative), and short-acting corticosteroids on alternate days (given for short periods at times when there are flare-ups, to mimimize the potentially serious side-effects).','There are many skin diseases that cause itching, and they can all look rather similar on physical examination. Your veterinarian will ask you questions about your dog''s diet, environment, any kind of skin care you are already providing, whether any other pets or people in the house are itchy, where and how quickly did the skin lesions start, and is there any seasonal pattern to the itching. The answers, as well as the age and breed of your dog, will provide diagnostic clues. For example, itching that begins suddenly and rapidly gets worse, is more typical of a flea allergy, scabies, or a drug hypersensitivity. Itching that begins insidiously and gradually worsens, is seen more often with atopy, food allergy, bacterial or yeast skin infection, and seborrhea. Skin infections and seborrhea commonly develop secondary to atopy and may have to be cleared up before your veterinarian can diagnose atopy. Diagnostic tests may include multiple skin scrapings and smears (for mites or yeast infection), fecal examination (for parasites), skin biopsy, skin testing (for allergies to different substances), elimination diets or change in environment (if food or contact allergy is suspected),','The condition is usually first seen between 1 and 3 years of age, although it may develop as late as 6 or 7. Initially atopy may be seasonal (eg. from spring to fall) but most affected dogs eventually have signs all year round. Dogs with atopy are very itchy. The areas most affected are the face, paws, lower legs, groin, and, less often, the ears and eyes. In addition to scratching themselves with their hind feet, they often lick or chew the affected areas, or rub along the carpet to scratch the face or ears. The intense itching can make them irritable and less tolerant of being handled. Initially, there are no apparent skin abnormalities, except possibly slight reddening, even though the dog is clearly itchy. (This is important because in other conditions there is often a rash or some visible lesion.) Over time, lesions develop as a result of the scratching and self-trauma, bacterial or yeast infections, and seborrhea, all of which can contribute to the objectionable odor of these dogs. The skin becomes reddened and eventually darkened (hyperpigmentation), abraded, thickened, and wrinkled, with loss of hair and bronze staining from saliva. The concept of "allergen load" is important in understanding and treating this disorder. Atopic dogs are generally allergic to more than 1 agent. A small amount of allergens may be tolerated without developing a reaction, but an increase in any one of those  (ie. an increase in allergen load such as occurs during pollen season) may push your dog over the edge to an allergic reaction of extreme discomfort.',NULL,'Although the specific mode of inheritance is unknown, it is best not to breed affected dogs, their parents, and preferably their siblings as well, given the strong familial predisposition to this condition.');

In the most serious cases, with very large atrial septal defects, there may be visible symptoms, such as exercise intolerance or respiratory difficulties, that prompt a visit to the veterinarian, where an atrial septal defect is discovered. A heart murmur alone is never conclusive for atrial septal defects, because many other cardiac defects cause similar murmurs, and many pups may have healthy hearts and a murmur that goes away after a few weeks as part of normal growth.  Therefore, if the features of a heart murmur make the veterinarian suspicious of the possibility of an atrial septal defect, then he or she will recommend tests, especially thoracic radiographs (chest X-rays) and an echocardiogram (also called cardiac ultrasound or sonogram of the heart).  These noninvasive tests can identify clearly whether an atrial septal defect is present, and if it is, whether there is reason for concern (and whether treatment is necessary).','The main determinant of the impact of an atrial septal defect is its size.  A small defect usually will be of no significance to a dog, and indeed most dogs with small atrial septal defects live normal lives. With larger defects, however, there will be abnormal blood flow from the higher pressure left side of the heart across the defect to the right side. This causes more work for the heart , which can eventually lead to congestive heart failure.

In training sessions, you may notice that your dog responds better to hand signals than verbal cues.

Short-term side effects include increased water intake, increased urination, increased appetite, and destruction of joint cartilage. Long-term side effects are numerous and include suppression of the immune system, infections, diabetes, liver disease, joint problems, obesity, glaucoma, cataracts, high blood pressure and stomach ulcers.

In other dwarf dogs, where the condition is neither normal nor desirable, orthopedic surgery may be available to try and realign their short, crooked legs. Depending upon the cause of the dog’s short stature, the puppy’s age and whether or not the growth plates of affected bones are open or closed, advanced surgical techniques may be available to help the long bones of the legs to lengthen. However, these surgeries are complicated and costly. The surgical procedures would have to be done separately - and at different times - on each of the puppy’s legs. Recovery from each surgery would be long and potentially painful. As a practical matter, surgical correction of dwarfism is not considered to be a realistic option.If the condition is painful, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and other medications designed to provide pain relieve (analgesics) can be prescribed by the treating veterinarian. Certain supplements can help to lubricate the joints and provide some protection for developing or aging cartilage. These include glucosamine, chondroitin sulfate and polysulfated glycosaminoglycans. Owners should discuss use of supplements with their veterinarian.Dogs with pituitary dwarfism theoretically can be treated with growth hormone replacement therapy','The results of a urinalysis and routine blood work (a complete blood count and serum biochemistry profile) are almost always normal in dwarf dogs, unless they also happen to have some unrelated medical disorder or disease. Usually, the physical appearance of the dog, its breed and its history are sufficient to enable the veterinarian to make a presumptive diagnosis of genetic dwarfism with some degree of confidence. Radiographs (X-rays) of the short legs, and of the skull and spine if they also appear abnormal, probably will show atypical growth of both cartilage and bone. A definitive diagnosis of dwarfism can be made by taking bone biopsies and submitting the samples to a laboratory for microscopic evaluation by a veterinary pathologist.Pituitary dwarfism can be diagnosed through hormonal testing of blood samples. The veterinarian will be looking for the level of growth hormone in circulation; pituitary dwarfs will have very low circulating levels of that particular hormone. Computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can also be used to identify the tiny pituitary cysts which commonly are present in the pituitary gland of pituitary dwarfs.','These may include:Short legs (usually in the correct proportion to one another; seen in virtually all dwarf dogs);Long body (in comparison to short legs);Bowed legs (especially noticeable in the front legs);Enlarged joints (elbow, stifle/knee, carpus/wrist, tarsus/ankle);Outward-turned feet (valgus deformity; especially prominent in front feet);Large, wide head;Pronounced, protruding lower jaw (mandible);Short upper jaw (maxilla);Underbite (front upper teeth are behind the front lower teeth when the mouth is shut);Depressed or caved-in appearance to the maxilla and muzzle which adversely affects respiration (depressed nasal bridge);Difficulty breathing (dyspnea);Loud, snoring-like breathing (stertorous respiration);Excessive panting;Protruding tongue (partially sticking out of the mouth; frequently curls upward over the flat nose while the dog is panting);Bulging eyes;Distended abdomen;Occasional spinal deviations;Occasional spinal pain','Dwarfism – or short stature in dogs - can be caused by a wide variety of things.

There are no realistic medical (drug) therapies for ectopic ureters. Even with surgery, affected animals may remain incontinent, depending in large part upon the status of their urethral sphincter mechanism which plays a huge role in the voluntary withholding or passage of urine. There are a few medications that may help to reduce incontinence, depending on its cause. For example, antibiotics can help to clear up a urinary tract infection (UTI) which can contribute to incontinence. It is very important to treat UTIs before any surgical correction is contemplated. However, this will not “treat” or “cure” the ectopic ureter itself.','More advanced testing may involve ultrasound examination to assess the anatomical integrity of urinary tract structures. This procedure, when performed by a person skilled in ultrasonography, is usually diagnostic of ectopic ureters. Contrast radiography can also be used, although it is more invasive. This involves inserting contrast media into the dog’s urinary tract and then taking films (radiographs; X-rays) as that material moves through and out of that tract. While standard radiographs without contrast media may be helpful, they are not as reliable as either ultrasound or contrast studies. Computed tomography (CT scan) may be available at some specialized veterinary clinics. CT scans are extremely accurate to diagnose this disorder. Other techniques, such as urethrocystoscopy, vaginal urethrography and excretory urography, can permit the veterinarian to visualize anatomical abnormalities and localize the terminal openings of ectopic ureters into the bladder, urethra, vagina or somewhere else.','Dogs with ectopic ureters have symptoms that can range from mild to severe. Males are often asymptomatic, which means that they do not display any outward signs of having the condition. Dogs with only one affected ureter may continue to pass urine normally. The process of urinating is called “micturition.” When clinical signs of ectopic ureters are present, owners might notice one or more of the following:Urinary incontinience (intermittent or continuous; usually suggests bilateral condition);Inappropriate elimination (urinating in unusual areas);Persistent urine dribbling (especially in juvenile animals);Dampness around the external genitalia;Cloudy urine (pyuria; from pus in the urine);Foul-smelling urine (from infection somewhere along the urinary tract);Redness, inflammation and irritation of the hair and skin around a female dog’s vulva and vagina (vulvitis and vaginitis due to urine scalding).','Certain breeds seem to have a predisposition to being born with ectopic ureters. This is called a congenital defect. Because of the prevalence of the abnormality in those breeds, the defect also appears to have a genetic component, rather than just occurring randomly during prenatal development. Unfortunately, the mode of inheritance is not well-understood. The involvement of heredity also is not consistent. Bitches with ectopic ureters are known to have whelped litters in which none of their offspring is born with the condition – or at least none of them exhibit the intermittent or persistent incontinence so commonly associated with this conformational abnormality.

Dogs who have tongues that are already swollen or cracked may be offered drugs for pain relief, and if the tongue has developed an infection, then the appropriate antibiotic or antifungal medications will be prescribed. For dogs that do not have control of their tongues, the veterinarian may recommend that you feed your dog food that is soft and easy to swallow in an attempt to prevent damage to the tongue during feeding times. For some dogs with overly large tongues, sometimes referred to as macroglossia, the size of the tongue may severely interfere with eating, drinking, and even sleeping. In cases where the size or condition of the tongue is interfering greatly with the patient’s quality of life, surgical resection of the tongue, known as a glossectomy, may be recommended.','When you bring your pet into the clinic in regards to its hanging tongue, the visit is likely to start with a complete physical examination, including standard diagnostic tests such as a urinalysis, complete blood count, and a biochemical profile.

When examining the mouth area, the veterinarian will also evaluate the state of the dog’s teeth and check to see if the tongue is abnormally large for the oral cavity. If the tongue is too large for the oral cavity, the examining veterinarian will also evaluate how much of an effect it is likely to have on the animal’s quality of life. In some cases, an x-ray of the mouth and jaw area may uncover poorly healed breaks or other trauma that may be causing the inability to better control the tongue.','Dogs who have developed hanging tongue syndrome may experience several different symptoms that are likely to require attention and may even be indicative of additional disorders.

Do not breed dogs whose offspring have hipdysplasia (dogs with hipdysplasia can produce normal offspring, and normal-appearing dogs canproduce offspringwith hip dysplasia).

Adding to your dog’s diet with live cultured yogurt products and probiotics can greatly assist your pet''s condition. Often treatment is for life, focusing on your pets’ diet, regular medication and supplements.  For exocrine pancreatic insufficiency, a pancreatic extract such as lypex or pancrex will be needed.

Medical treatment may be successful when there is only mild to moderate pain, and no weakness or paralysis. Medical, or conservative, treatment consists of anti-inflammatory medication in combination with strict cage rest (your dog will be confined to a cage, and let out only to urinate and defecate while on a leash). If your dog''s condition worsens, or there is no sign of improvement within a week or so, surgical treatment should be considered. Surgery will be recommended, and will be necessary, if your dog shows more severe neurologic signs, or if your dog has repeated episodes of pain and muscle weakness. Where there is paralysis and loss of deep pain sensation, surgery to remove the pressure on the spinal cord should be performed within 24 hours, or there is likely to be permanent nerve damage. The prognosis (prospect for recovery) after surgery ranges from fair to good, depending on factors such as the severity of clinical signs before surgery, the rapidity with which the signs developed, and the length of the interval between the onset of problems and surgery. Where there has been paralysis and loss of deep pain perception for more than 24 hours, surgery is not likely to result in improvement. Once your veterinarian has examined your dog, s/he will discuss treatment options with you. If surgery appears to be the best option, she will likely discuss with you referral to an appropriate surgical facility, because of the specialized radiographic and surgical techniques required.

Your dog may also become incontinent. Your veterinarian will examine your dog, and perform a neurologic exam to test your dog&rsquo;s reflexes and the function of nerves. The absence or in some cases, heightening, of reflexes will help to determine where the pressure on the spinal cord is occurring. Plain x-rays of the vertebral column are taken of suspect areas, to locate abnormalities of the vertebrae or mineralization of the intervertebral discs. A specialized radiographic technique calledmyelographyis necessary to pinpoint the areas of spinal cord compression, if surgical repair is being considered. In order to do a myelogram, your dog is anesthetized, dye is injected into the spinal canal, and x-rays are taken which will show the exact location(s) of spinal cord compression. A spinal tap, also performed under general anesthesia, is done to obtain a sample of cerebrospinal fluid and rule out other causes of your dog''s spinal cord disease. Your veterinarian may refer you to a veterinary referral centre for these specialized radiographic techniques, and for possible surgery.','The clinical signs vary, depending on whether there is type I or II IVDD, where in the spine the herniation occurs, and the extent of the protrusion of disk material into the spinal canal. Signs with type I generally develop more quickly (over hours or even minutes) and are more severe. Depending on the location and extent of the pressure on the spinal cord, there may be pain in the neck region, lack of pain sensation in the limbs, and weakness or paralysis in any or all limbs. This is a very serious disease, which may result in permanent hindlimb paralysis and incontinence if left untreated. While confinement may help initially in some cases, surgery is often required to relieve pressure on the spinal cord. The outcome will depend on a number of factors (including the severity of clinical signs, whether pain perception is still present, and length of time between the onset of clinical signs and surgery, to name a few).

If problems with the palate persist, a fistula may result and become infected. In cases of misaligned teeth (or malocclusion), the dog may have difficulty chewing, picking up food, and may be inclined to eat only larger pieces. They are also prone to tartar and plaque build-up. There are several types of diagnosable malocclusion: Overbite (sometimes called overshot, Class 2, overjet, or mandibular brachygnathism), Underbite (also called undershot, reverse scissor bite, prognathism, and Class 3), Level bite (sometimes called even bite), Open bite (front teeth don’t meet each other when mouth is closed), Anterior crossbite (canine and premolars occlude normally but one or more lower incisors are in front of the upper incisors), Posterior crossbite (one or more premolar teeth overlap the upper teeth), Wry mouth or bite (one side of jaw grows longer than the other), Base narrow canines (lower teeth protrude inward and can harm the upper palate). The tips of the premolars (the teeth right behind the canines) should touch the spaces between the upper premolars, which is called the scissor bite. However, it is normal for flat-faced breeds (brachycephalic) such as Boxers, Shih Tzus, and Lhasa Apsos not to have scissor bites. With an overbite, the upper jaw is longer than the lower one. When the mouth is closed, a gap between the upper and lower incisors occurs. Puppies born with an overbite will sometimes have the problem correct itself if the gap is not too large. However, a dog''s bite will usually set at ten months old. At this time improvement will not happen on its own. Your pet''s overbite may worsen as the permanent teeth come in because they are larger and can damage the soft parts of the mouth. Teeth extractions are sometimes necessary.','The way the upper teeth align with the lower teeth is called occlusion. It is normal for most breeds to have a slight overlap of the upper front teeth. When the jaw is closed, the lower canine (fang) should fit in front of the upper canine. Most cases of malocclusion have a hereditary link.','Most bite malocclusions do not require treatment. In some cases, extractions may be necessary. It’s a good idea to brush the teeth regularly to prevent abnormal build-up of tartar and plaque.

If the entire lining of the cyst is not removed, the cyst will likely come back. Your veterinarian may recommend that the cyst be submitted for biopsy to rule out life-threatening oral melanoma, or other conditions such as radicular cysts, periapical cysts, granulomas, or abscesses. Any surrounding teeth will be evaluated at the time of surgery. If surrounding teeth are not vital, then they will need to be extracted or treated with a root canal. If the oral cyst has caused bone loss, your dental surgeon may recommend a bone graft to regrow bone and stabilize the jaw. The best treatment for oral cysts is to catch them before they even start. In puppies and young dogs, multiple physical exams that include complete oral exams and teeth counting are an important part of ensuring that your dog does not suffer from an undiagnosed oral cyst. Prevention of development tooth problems is another reason why puppy visits and regular exams with your local veterinarian are so important. If you take your puppy to a vaccine clinic for puppy shots or get vaccines from a feed store, your puppy is not getting the care that he or she needs to have the best lifelong health.','If your veterinarian notices that your dog has unexplained missing teeth and recommends intra-oral dental X-rays under sedation or general anesthesia, then schedule it to be done as soon as possible. If it is a young dog who still needs to be spayed or neutered, X-rays can be done at the time of the surgery. The good news is that if your veterinarian tells you that your dog’s teeth developed normally and are all accounted for, then there is no longer any concern about oral cyst development. If an unerupted tooth is detected in a young dog, then have it removed as soon as possible to avoid the risk of an oral cyst. If you have an older dog (7 to 8 years or older) who has an unerupted tooth that is detected on dental radiographs with no evidence of cyst formation, follow your veterinarian’s recommendations. He or she may recommend removing the tooth or yearly monitoring of the tooth with radiographs. Boxers sometimes can have supernumerary teeth—that is, more than 42 teeth. If you have a young Boxer with a normal tooth count, talk with your veterinarian about his or her recommendations. You may want to err on the side of safety and have the teeth X-rayed at the time of spay or neuter to rule out the possibility of undetected, unerupted supernumerary teeth.','In a dog, an oral cyst is a fluid-filled sac that surrounds the enamel of an unerupted tooth. Oral cysts are considered benign in that they don’t invade local tissues. However, as the sac expands, it puts pressure on surrounding teeth and bone. Within a remarkably short period of time, oral cysts can destroy teeth and weaken the jaw enough to cause a pathological fracture, which is why early detection and treatment is so important. Oral cysts typically form in premolars on the lower jaw, though any tooth can be affected. If a cyst grows large enough, it can be seen by the naked eye as a blueish swelling of the gums. The problem with oral cysts is that by the time they grow big enough to be seen, it has been causing pain and irreversible damage to the jaw and surrounding teeth, and surgical repair may be extensive.',NULL,NULL);

An enlarged esophagus called megaesophagus can result and causes regurgitation of food.','The basis of treatment for MG is a drug that slows the breakdown of acetylcholine at the muscle receptors (anticholinesterase), allowing more time for neurotransmission to occur effectively. Your veterinarian will work with you to adjust the levels of this drug, based on the duration of increased muscle strength, and also to determine the slight daily adjustments that may be necessary due to changes in your dog''s activity or stress levels. She will also discuss with you the signs of overdosage with an anticholinesterase, such as increased salivation and anxiety. Many dogs will recover completely from acquired MG in a few weeks or months while others, after a period of successful treatment, will no longer respond to the anticholinesterase. Aspiration pneumonia because of megaesophagus is the major complication with this condition. It is very important that this be diagnosed and treated early, and subsequently avoided as much as possible by appropriate management, such as providing food and water from an elevated position and having your dog remain standing for 5 to 10 minutes following feeding. Your veterinarian will discuss this with you. Congenital MG: The same drugs are used, but unfortunately are less effective. Pups usually become progressively worse despite treatment, to the point of generalized weakness, loss of muscle mass, and inabilty to walk. For the veterinarian:A trial-and -error approach is used in the medical management of MG. Dosage levels of long-acting anticholinesterase drugs (eg. pyridostigmine bromide) are based on the severity of the signs and the size and activity level of the dog, and varied as necessary. Overdose can produce signs of muscarinic (urination, defecation, salivation, bradycardia), nicotinic (muscle fasciculations, tremors) or CNS (anxiety, anorexia, hyperactivity) stimulation. Immunosuppressive doses of corticosteroids can be tried in refractory cases of acquired MG, but only in the absence of aspiration pneumonia. Certain drugs (including aminoglycoside antibiotics, phenothiazines, and methoxyflurane) may worsen disorders of neuromuscular transmission and should be used with caution, if at all, in dogs with suspected MG .','Diagnosis is made based on the clinical signs and diagnostic tests. Helpful tests include nerve conduction studies, and the injection of an drug that causes a build-up of acetylcholine at the receptors. A rapid, temporary improvement in your dog''s strength means that the problems are likely due to myasthenia gravis. In acquired MG, a special blood test can be used to detect antibodies against the acetylcholine receptors. A chest x-ray is recommended as well, because megaesophagus is so common with this disorder.','The classical picture of this disease is an exercise-related muscle weakness that improves following rest. Withcongenital MG, signs are generally noticed in pups by 6 to 9 weeks of age, when they are learning to walk. They may walk a few steps and then have to rest. When tired, the face may droop. Chewing and swallowing may be difficult and they may regurgitate food and develop a dilated esophagus (megaesophagus), particularly the smooth fox terrier. The average age for the development ofacquired MGis around 5 years. The signs are similar - muscle weakness that becomes worse with exercise, and improves after the dog rests. Regurgitation and megaesophagus are more common with the acquired form and may lead to aspiration pneumonia due to inhalation of regurgitated food particles.

While it may resolve in puppies, an open fontanel will remain with an adult dog throughout his entire life. For those dogs who have associated or concurrent problems, such as hydrocephalus, treatment is usually needed.  Medications If caught early, hydrocephalus is treated with medication to reduce both brain inflammation, such as with corticosteroids, and the amount of cerebrospinal fluid produced, often with omeprazole. More severe cases may also need anti-seizure medications, diuretics to reduce fluid production, and electrolytes. Surgery For a more permanent solution, a ventriculoperitoneal shunt can be placed. This is a small tube surgically implanted into a ventricle of the brain to take the excess cerebrospinal fluid and safely drain it to another part of the body. As your dog grows, additional surgeries are often required to re-fit the shunt. Complications of this procedure include infections, and over or under drainage.

Amputation is a first-line procedure, which increases survival, brings pain relief, thereby delays euthanasia. It completely removes the primary tumor, decreases the risk of postoperative complications, shortens the time of anesthesia and decreases the expense in comparison with the limb-sparing procedure. However, limb-sparing procedures are receiving growing popularity. The bone can be reconstructed with an endoprothesis (metal implant) or cortical allograft. Limb function is preserved in over 80 % of dogs following limb-sparing surgery, however, complications such as infections (in 30–50 % of patients) or implant failure (20–40 %) are relatively common. Moreover, tumor recurrence appears in 15–25 % of cases. As a result this technique is recommended for dogs with compromising neurologic or orthopedic problems, or it can be favorable for owners who refuse to perform limb amputation. In the absence of chemotherapy, the average survival time in dogs receiving amputation alone is approximately 19 weeks. Dogs treated with adjunctive therapy had a prolonged median survival time (307 days) in comparison to those after surgery alone. Dogs with appendicular OSA treated with cisplatin as an adjuvant therapy to amputation or limb-sparing surgery (322 days), than with surgery alone.

Other ways of diagnosing these conditions include skin scrapings from the dog''s ear flaps to test for parasites, and skin biopsies to check for autoimmune diseases. However, the single most important tool for diagnosing otitis externa and otitis media is a microscopic examination of the ear discharge (aural exudate).','The most common symptoms of otitis externa and otitis media are pain, head shaking, scratching at the external ear flaps, and bad odor. In a physical examination by a veterinarian, a dog with the condition may exhibit redness and swelling of the external ear canal, scaling skin or obstruction of the ear canal. Signs such as tilting the head, anorexia, uncoordination, and occasional vomiting may indicate the development of otitis media, or otitis interna, if the infection and inflammation spreads to the inner ear.','Otitis externa and otitis media can be caused by a variety of things. The primary causes are parasites, food allergies, drug reactions, foreign bodies (e.g., plant awns), accumulation of hair, dead skin buildup (keratinization), and autoimmune diseases. Other factors that may contribute to the onset of the inflammatory conditions include bacterial infections, mixed infections caused by bacteria and fungal species, and progressive changes in the environment of the outer ear canal.

In cases of misaligned teeth (or malocclusion), the dog may have difficulty chewing, picking up food, and may be inclined to eat only larger pieces. They are also prone to tartar and plaque build-up. There are several types of diagnosable malocclusion: Overbite (sometimes called overshot, Class 2, overjet, or mandibular brachygnathism), Underbite (also called undershot, reverse scissor bite, prognathism, and Class 3), Level bite (sometimes called even bite), Open bite (front teeth don’t meet each other when mouth is closed), Anterior crossbite (canine and premolars occlude normally but one or more lower incisors are in front of the upper incisors), Posterior crossbite (one or more premolar teeth overlap the upper teeth), Wry mouth or bite (one side of jaw grows longer than the other), Base narrow canines (lower teeth protrude inward and can harm the upper palate). The tips of the premolars (the teeth right behind the canines) should touch the spaces between the upper premolars, which is called the scissor bite. However, it is normal for flat-faced breeds (brachycephalic) such as Boxers, Shih Tzus, and Lhasa Apsos not to have scissor bites. With an overbite, the upper jaw is longer than the lower one.

Historically, surgery consisted of an operation under general anesthesia involving thoracotomy (open-chest, closed-heart procedure) to ligate the ductus and close it permanently with stitches. Nowadays, a minimally invasive procedure has replaced this approach in a majority of cases. The catheter-based approach, called deployment of an Amplatzer canine ductal occluder, involves passage of a self-expanding double-umbrella-shaped plug that closes the ductus from within. Like angioplasty in a person, this procedure does not require opening the chest, but rather is performed by passing a catheter through the femoral vein (in the groin) or jugular vein (in the neck). When surgery is performed early and successfully, the long-term outlook for a normal life is generally excellent. That is, surgery performed when there is only a murmur and the puppy feels well has the greatest chance of success: changes in the heart caused by the PDA can return to normal and there may be no permanent damage at all. Where there are overt symptoms, the treatment of choice remains surgery because the underlying problem must be corrected. The degree of secondary damage to the heart is highly variable and often can only be known in hindsight: the surgery must be performed and a recheck 6-8 weeks post-operatively reveals the degree of improvement and expected long-term outlook (i.e., whether medications will need to be given, whether a normal lifespan may be expeted, etc.). The problems associated with the far less common right-to-left shunt are managed without surgery. Treatment includes mild exercise restriction (avoiding vigorous or prolonged activity) and avoidance of stress. Medications, and/or periodic bloodletting (phlebotomy) can help improve circulation in these cases.','Usually a PDA is first suspected when the veterinarian hears a telltale type of heart murmur -the "machinery," or "washing-machine" continuous heart murmur- with the stethoscope when examining a dog during puppyhood as part of a routine appointment for vaccinations. Much less commonly the heart murmur may go unnoticed until later, when overt symptoms emerge, as described above. Either way, any suspicion of PDA warrants confirmation, which requires thoracic radiographs (X-rays of the chest) and an echocardiogram (also called cardiac ultrasound, or sonogram of the heart). These tests identify the PDA itself, its secondary effects on the heart and lungs, and any concurrent, unrelated heart defects that sometimes can be masked by PDA and help to determine whether a dog is a good surgical candidate for PDA repair.','With very few exceptions, PDA causes such a significant increase in the workload of the heart that without surgery, it causes congestive heart failure before a normal lifespan -- and often in the first year or two of life. Therefore, a suspicion of PDA requires confirmation (see below) and treatment via surgery. Dogs never "outgrow" a PDA, and most dogs are fully asymptomatic when they have it: PDA causes no symptoms until very late in its course, when permanent damage to the heart has occurred. The speed and degree of damage caused by PDA varies, depending on the magnitude of the defect. This cannot be known from physical examination alone; tests are needed to identify the size of the PDA (larger is worse) and the corresponding impact on the heart and the rest of the body''s circulation. Most commonly with PDA, there is a shunt from the left to the right side of the heart, with blood from the higher pressure aorta continuously shunted to the main pulmonary artery. This means an increased volume of blood to the lungs which results in fluid accumulation in the lung tissue (pulmonary edema) and volume overload of the left heart. Left unchecked, these consequences may lead to life-threatening overt symptoms such as breathlessness very laboured breathing due to poor oxygenation, severely reduced tolerance of exercise, and even fainting or collapsing. Much less commonly (about 2% of PDA cases), there is a right-to-left shunt. This may be the case from birth, or it may develop because the PDA is so large that the pressure in the lungs, and resultant resistance to this pressure, markedly increase. In effect, the circulation is the same as when the dog was a fetus - that is, some of the blood leaving the right side of the heart bypasses the lungs entirely. This results in circulation of poorly oxygenated blood. Dogs with right-to-left shunting PDA classically have weakness or collapse of the hindlegs associated with exercise: they slow down and sit mid-walk and are reluctant to start again, but eventually do, only to slow down and sit again as the poorly-oxygenated hindlegs become weak and cramped.',NULL,'Dogs in whom PDA has been diagnosed, with or without surgical correction, should not be used for breeding.

Once the condition is under control, your veterinarian will reduce the dosage to every second day to avoid the side effects which can occur with these drugs. Long term treatment is generally necessary. Where prednisone is not effective (as is sometimes the case), your veterinarian will try other immunomodulating drugs or chrysotherapy (gold salts). For dogs that have lost pigment in the nose, protection against the sun is important to prevent flare-ups of the condition. Keep your dog out of the sun between 10:00 and 3:00 and/or use suncreens on the nose with SPF of 15 or higher.

It can be challenging to determine whether the mass is malignant or not, so the needle biopsy is a useful diagnostic test. In some cases an incision and a full biopsy are needed to properly diagnose the mass. Some veterinarians will also use imaging to look at the mass, such as X-rays or ultrasounds.','The most common sign of anal gland cancer is a rectal mass or tumor.

Generally surgery is required, and there are several methods used including surgical removal of the tracts, freezing or cautery of the tissue, and tail amputation. Possible post-operative complications include significant bleeding, fecal incontinence, and recurrence of the tracts. In mild cases, surgery often results in complete resolution of the problem, without recurrence.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(242,'Perianal gland tumor','-','The perianal glands are sebaceous-like structures in the perianal skin of dogs, located close to the anus. Perianal gland tumors originate from these glands, and most commonly develop in intact, older dogs and spayed females. ','Treatment for these tumors can vary, and can be more difficult if they have spread. Treatment for tumors that are diagnosed as malignant aims to improve your dog’s quality of life, while benign masses can be completely resolved.  For intact, male dogs, the primary treatment is the removal of one or both testes. This eliminates much of the testosterone, which can result in regression of small and benign tumors. Your dog is monitored after castration to assess if further removal is necessary.  In both male and female dogs, small tumors can also be removed with cryotherapy, which freezes off the masses. For larger or malignant tumors, surgical removal may be necessary. Fecal incontinence can result from surgery due to damage to the sphincter muscle which is next to the perianal gland.  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be prescribed in addition to castration, and are generally given over several weeks. Estrogen therapy can be administered to shrink tumors, and is used especially in cases where castration is not an option in male dogs. A side effect of estrogen therapy is a life threatening condition of bone marrow suppression. Supportive treatments can include soothing creams for irritated anal skin, and medications to reduce blood calcium levels, improve kidney function, and alleviate pain and nausea.','A physical exam can help your veterinarian determine if the masses or nodules on your dog’s anal area may be tumors. Often a urinalysis is performed, as well as blood work that can reveal an elevated blood calcium level, a sign of these types of growths.  Many perianal gland tumors will be benign, but a small percentage of these growths can be malignant. A tissue sample by a fine-needle aspirate or by a surgical biopsy will be examined under the microscope to determine what kind of tumor your dog has. Chest and abdominal X-rays and ultrasounds can also help to determine of the tumors have spread, such as to the lymph nodes or prostate gland.','The presence of a perianal gland tumor is usually not painful for your dog, but it can cause your dog to pay a lot of attention to that area. While these nodules can grow without any symptoms for months or years, they can eventually rupture and bleed, leaving your dog susceptible to infections. Tumors may appear as single or multiple masses in the anal area, and can create a thickened ring around the anus. Signs include: Round, nodules in the skin near anus Thickened ring of tissue surrounding anus Bleeding nodules Excessive licking of the anal area Scooting rear end on ground Colorectal obstruction  Rectal pain Protruding rectal mucous membrane  Straining to defecate  Bloody feces  Vomiting blood Increased thirst Increased urination  Decreased appetite Lethargy Reduced exercise tolerance  Growth on the testes Hypercalcemia, or elevated blood calcium levels Types Perianal gland tumors are categorized as benign adenomas and malignant carcinomas Benign adenomas are masses of the perianal glands that are not classified as cancerous and do not spread Malignant carcinomas, or adenocarcinomas, are also masses of the perianal glands. These are uncommon cancerous masses that are hard to distinguish from benign adenomas, but can spread to other locations in the body and cause hypercalcemia, or increased blood calcium levels that can lead to kidney failure. Malignant carcinomas require more intensive diagnostic testing and treatments, therefore it is necessary to determine if your dog’s tumors are malignant.','While the definitive cause of perianal gland tumors is still unknown, testosterone is believed to influence cell proliferation in the glands. Male dogs have an increased risk compared to females in developing these tumors. For females, adrenocortical hormones may play an important role in tumor growth.  Additionally, genetic factors may also influence the possible progression of this type of tumor. Breeds who seem to be at a higher risk include: Beagles Cocker Spaniels English Bulldogs Samoyed breeds ','For benign perianal gland tumors, recovery is very good. Neutering leads to a complete regression in 95% of these cases. Your dog may need post-operative care, and should be seen by your veterinarian in 1 to 3 months to monitor tumor regression. In a small percentage of cases, tumors may recur, but can be treated.  If your dog has a malignant tumor, post-operative care may be longer and more intense. You may need to monitor your dog for complications, such as infections and fecal incontinence. Your dog may need frequent veterinary visits for treatments.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(243,'Persistent right aortic arch','794,1570','A developmental abnormalitiy where one of the fetal blood vessels near the heart does not atrophy as it should.','Correcting vascular ring anomalies/persistent right aortic arches requires surgery. The operation consists of a thoracotomy (opening the chest) and ligation and transection of the ligamentum arteriosum, the most accessible component of the ring constricting the esophagus. Surgery should be performed as early in a puppy''s life as possible, to reduce the likelihood of permanent damage to the esophagus due to chronic distension. Postoperative care involves feeding a liquid diet with the puppy held upright in a sitting position for some time after feeding, to help the liquid diet pass down to the stomach. After days to weeks, solid food is gradually reintroduced in the form of frequent small meals. In some dogs occasional regurgitation may persist despite surgery, but even in these cases, dogs tend to do much better than if they had not had surgical correction.','This condition is suspected when a puppy first begins regurgitating within a few days of weaning. It is important to note that regurgitation, which is a passive process, is different from vomiting, which is an active process. Regurgitation involves the puppy producing undigested food and mucus through the mouth with no effort; the pup tilts its head down and the food and mucus simply roll out. This is typical of vascular ring anomalies/persistent right aortic arch if it first occurs just after weaning. By contrast, vomiting is an active process, meaning there are abdominal contractions ("heaving") and a retching noise when food and mucus are expelled out the mouth. Vomiting is not   a symptom of vascular ring anomalies. The distinction between regurgitation and vomiting is important because vascular ring anomalies/persistent right aortic arch only ever cause regurgitation, whereas dozens of disorders may cause a pup to vomit. Chest x-rays are the confirmatory test of choice. The deviation of certain vital structures, notably the trachea, on X-ray, is conclusive in virtually all cases. Feeding an X-ray dye called barium was formerly thought to be essential for confirming persistent right aortic arch but is now known to be essentially obsolete. Chest X-rays also help differentiate vascular ring anomaly/persistent right aortic arch from juvenile diffuse megaesophagus, which is a generalized weakening of the esophagus that many puppies simply outgrow without treatment. There is no benefit to performing echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound), electrocardiography (ECG/EKG), or other tests of the cardiovascualr system, unless the veterinarian suspects an additional, unrelated heart problem. Vascular ring anomalies alone do not cause abnormalities on echocardiograms or ECGs.','Signs of this condition usually become apparent shortly after weaning, when a puppy begins eating semi-solid or solid food. The partial obstruction of the esophagus causes regurgitation, which is a passive reflux of undigested food, often in a tubular shape, back out the mouth. Dogs with this condition are often excessively thin or even emaciated, and yet often have ravenous appetites. They are prone to aspiration pneumonia, meaning that they may choke on regurgitated food and become ill as a result of inhaled mucus, food, and water. Vascular ring anomalies like persistent right aortic arches can be corrected surgically. It is important to do so promptly, to reduce the likelihood of permanent damage to the esophagus. Vascular ring anomalies are never outgrown: they cannot self-correct spontaneously.',NULL,'Affected individuals and their parents should not be used for breeding.

Standard blood test results may show increased levels of eosinophilia (white blood cells), lymphocytosis (disease of the lymph glands), hypophosphatemia (phosphorus deficiency), or hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). Other laboratory tests will test the levels of hormones in the bloodstream. Your veterinarian will want to have your dog brought in for a morning blood draw in order to measure basal levels of TSH and prolactin. Another blood test, called a dynamic test, measures hormone levels after injection of a hormone stimulating substance. This can be used to check levels of ACTH and GH. The results of these tests generally are the best indicators for hypopituitarism. Visual imaging techniques, primarily using X-ray, can be used to check for the presence of a tumor or cyst in the vicinity of the pituitary gland.','The symptoms of hypopituitarism can vary depending on which hormones are lacking, and which body function is being affected by the deficit.

You will need to provide a thorough history of your dog''s health, onset of symptoms, and possible incidents that might have preceded this condition, such as whether your dog has had recent contact with a raccoon. As part of a standard physical examination, routine laboratory tests will include a complete blood count, biochemistry profile and urinalysis. Usually the results of all these tests are found to be within normal ranges. More specific tests will also be done, including specific testing for determination of abnormalities of electric activity in peripheral nerves, and an analysis of the spinal fluid, which will require a spinal tap, and the brain fluid (cerebrospinal fluid, or CSF), to look for specific infections that may be causing the paralysis.','Symptoms usually appear 7-14 days after contact with raccoon, Stiff gait, Generalized slow reflexes, Low muscle tone, Weakened vocal ability, Labored breathing, Decrease in muscle bulk, Facial muscle weakness, Muscular weakness in all four limbs which may progresses to paralysis in all limbs, Pain, Oversensitivity to pain stimuli','Besides the known connection that has been made with affected dogs coming into contact with raccoon saliva, the exact cause of ACIP is still unknown. Viral or bacterial infections are suspected to be responsible, and because of the correlation with the nervous system and neural pathways, an autoimmune link is being researched. It is thought that white blood cells may be attacking the nerves.','Good home nursing care is mandatory for speedy and successful recovery. Some affected dogs may require special consideration for proper feeding and drinking; you may even need to feed your dog by hand for a few days until it is able to eat on its own again. Rest is essential, and the easiest way to achieve is that is by setting aside a quiet, comfortable space in the home, away from entry ways and heavy use rooms, where your dog can recover. Do not allow the dog to get overexcited, or be bothered by active children or other pets. If it is difficult to limit your dog''s movement, cage rest may be considered a more practical option. While your dog is resting, make sure to check in throughout the day, turning it from one side to the other about every four hours in order to prevent pressure sores, which can result from prolonged rest in one position. Regular bathing is also required to prevent urine and fecal scalding. During the recovery period, stay close to home, with just short, slow outdoor trips for urinary and bowel relief. If your dog is too paralyzed to walk, you may need to consult with your veterinarian about the need for a catheter. Your veterinarian will brief you on the physiotherapy protocols to prevent further aggravation of weakened muscles, but massaging the muscles and gently stretching the dog''s limbs will help to keep the muscles from atrophying excessively. You may need to take your dog to veterinary physiotherapist for physiotherapy sessions over the course of several months. Stay in touch with your veterinarian, discussing any complications you may notice overtime and progress your dog is making. You may need to take your dog to a veterinarian for a regular progress evaluation every two to three weeks. Recovery is different for individual dogs. Some may begin to recover quickly, within days and weeks, while others never completely recover. At home care and therapy is essential, in either case.');

Produces night blindness (See #256.)','Progressive retinal atrophy (PRA) is always bilateral (affects both eyes) and always ends in complete blindness. There is no way to reverse or to treat retinal degeneration, or the total loss of vision that inevitably accompanies it.','PRA is diagnosed through extensive eye examinations. In many cases, general practice veterinarians will refer the owner to a specialized veterinary ophthalmologist to perform the diagnostic tests and arrive at a diagnosis. Routine eye examination can suggest the presence of progressive retinal atrophy. A definitive diagnosis typically is made by a veterinary eye specialist using an electroretinogram (ERG) to measure the retina’s ability to respond to light. During this examination, one electrode is placed on the dog’s cornea, and neutral electrodes are placed on the skin around the eye. The results of this test are conclusive.','Usually, the first sign of progressive retinal atrophy is night blindness, including a reluctance to go outside at night or to navigate unfamiliar areas in dimness or darkness. Other signs can include: Reluctance to jump on or off furniture during darkness. Night blindness (nyctalopia); reduced vision in dim light. Sluggish pupilary light responses. Decreased menace response. Cloudy or opaque eye surface; grayish discoloration of the surface of the eye. Greenish sheen to the eye. Cataracts. Bumping into furniture or walls. Tripping or stumbling over objects. Pawing at the air when going down stairs. Reluctance to navigate stairs.','Most forms of progressive retinal atrophy are passed from parent to offspring in an inheritance pattern known as “autosomal recessive.” This is especially true in Collies, Irish setters, Miniature poodles, Cocker spaniels, Briards, and Labrador retrievers. In these breeds, if a dog has inherited the gene responsible for PRA from only one parent, it will not develop the disease but will be a carrier of the trait – meaning that if bred, it can pass that gene on to its offspring. However, if a dog inherits the “PRA gene” from both parents, it will eventually develop clinical PRA. In several breeds, particularly Samoyeds and Siberian huskies, PRA is passed on in a dominant inheritance pattern, meaning that even if a dog gets only one copy of the gene, it will develop the disease. In many breeds, the mode of inheritance is not known. The key to preventing PRA is held by responsible breeders of affected breeds. These animals should be genetically screened for PRA by a board-certified veterinary ophthalmologist and have the results of that screening registered through the Canine Eye Registration Foundation (CERF). Dogs found to be carrying the gene for PRA – whether or not they actually have the disorder – should not be bred. Offspring of affected dogs likewise should not be bred. Responsible breeding practices are the only way to remove animals with PRA from the breeding population. Genetic testing of blood samples is available to identify whether a particular dog carries the gene for PRA. The best way to ensure that your new dog does not carry the PRA gene, and therefore will not develop the disorder, is to have both of its parents tested, if possible. This is especially important if the dog you are considering belongs to one of the commonly affected breeds, and even more so if you are thinking about breeding the animal in the future. Any dog found to be carrying a PRA gene should be spayed or neutered.','Progressive retinal atrophy will eventually result in blindness. There is no cure, prevention, or treatment currently available. However, with minor environmental accommodation (avoid rearranging the furniture, etc.), most affected dogs adjust very well to vision loss and can live long and healthy lives, particularly if their sight deteriorates gradually.');

The degree of visual impairment varies with the breed and specific type of retinal degeneration as described above, but most affected dogs will ultimately be completely blind. With their acute senses of smell and hearing, dogs can compensate very well, particularly in familiar surroundings, to the point where owners may be unaware of the extent of vision loss. You can help your dog by developing regular routes for exercise, maintaining consistent surroundings, introducing any necessary changes gradually, and being patient.','There are no obvious external changes to the eyes. You may notice that your dog has difficulty getting around when the lights are turned off, or when outside at night. If you suspect that your dog has impaired vision, your veterinarian will look for abnormalities with an ophthalmoscope. PRA may also be detected by electroretinogram(ERG) before your dog has any apparent visual difficulties. Electroretinography, which measures electrical patterns in the retina, is usually only available in specialty veterinary centres. (See CERF website listed in references below.) Genetic testing is quickly becoming available for different forms of PRA in different breeds. The advantage of such testing is that it can identify dogs whose sight is unaffected, but who are carriers of the disorder (heterozygotes).','Generalized PRA - early onset: The first sign is generally failing night vision, as early as 6 weeks of age, and this progresses to complete loss of vision by about 1 - 2 years of age. Collies may retain some vision until the age of 2 - 3 years. In miniature schnauzers, poor night vision usually develops later (6 months to a year) and there is advanced loss of vision by 3 to 4 years. Affected Alaskan malamutes are day-blind (hemeralopia) at 8 to 10 weeks of age; night vision is never affected. Generalized PRA (progressive rod-cone degeneration) - late onset: Generally night blindness is noticed between 2 and 5 years of age (depending on the breed) progressing to total blindness within a year or so. Peripheral vision is lost first. Central PRA (CPRA) - retinal pigment epithelial dystrophy (RPED):Loss of vision occurs much more slowly than in generalized PRA, without initial night blindness. Affected dogs may not lose vision completely. Because the changes are in the centre of the retina, affected dogs initially have trouble locating still objects in bright light.',NULL,'Breeding is not advised for any dog with PRA, or for the parents (assumed to be carriers). Siblings should be carefully screened by electroretinogram if they are considered for breeding. Generalized PRA can often be detected by electroretinography at least a year before clinical signs are apparent. For some disorders (eg. rod-cone dysplasia type I in Irish setters), blood-based DNA tests are available which can distinguish normal animals from those who are clinically normal but are carriers, and from those that are affected but are not yet showing any signs.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(257,'Prolapsed rectum','-','A condition where the inside of the rectum protrudes outside the anus.','If your dog has a concurrent bacterial or viral infection, or a parasitic infestation, your veterinarian will need to treat it first with an appropriate antibiotic or anti-parasitic drug. Once the underlying cause of the prolapse has been identified and treated, your veterinarian will first need to decrease the swelling and return the displaced tissue to its proper location inside the dog''s anus. This may be done manually by performing a gentle massage on the area, or by using lubricating gels or topical agents (e.g., a 50 percent dextrose solution), which aids in the reduction of the swelling. An anesthetic agent may be administered to relieve pain and discomfort. The anesthetic most commonly used is an epidural; however, your veterinarian will make his decision based upon your dog''s individual needs. Next, your veterinarian may choose to stitch the protruding tissue in its proper location to keep the tissue in place and to prevent a recurrence of a prolapse. Purse string sutures are the likeliest choice for this procedure, and the stitches will be left loose enough to allow room for excretion. If the disorder is found to be deeper in the dog''s rectal canal, the intestine may require surgical repairing.','Your veterinarian will perform a complete physical examination of your dog, including a chemical blood profile and a complete blood count. The results will usually return normal, though there may be high levels of white blood cells, similar to that seen when an infection is present. A test of stools samples may reveal the presence of parasites. Further diagnostic procedures include X-rays or ultrasounds of the abdominal area, which may demonstrate a large prostate, foreign bodies, thickening of the bladder walls, or kidney stones. Your doctor will also conduct a manual rectal examination to feel for displaced tissue masses. During pathological examination of the tissue (for biopsy), it may appear swollen, and will ooze red blood when incised. The tissue, if dead, appears dark purple or black and oozes bluish blood when incised.','Rectal prolapse occurs when all layers of the anal/rectal tissue, along with the rectal lining, protrude through the external anal opening. The protrusion of the rectal lining through the external anal opening, meanwhile, is solely referred to as anal prolapse. Dogs with rectal prolapse will demonstrate persistent straining while passing stool (or defecating). In an incomplete prolapse, a small portion of the lining of the rectum will be visible during excretion, after which it will subside. In a complete prolapse, there will be a persistent mass of tissue protruding from the anus. In the chronic stages of complete prolapse, this tissue might be black or blue in appearance.','A dog may develop rectal or anal prolapse if it strains while passing stool, or if it undergoes surgery to the lower digestive organs. Other contributing factors for these two conditions include: Disorders of the digestive system that cause diarrhea, straining while passing stools, presence of worms or other parasites in the digestive system, and inflammation of the small or large intestines, Disorders of the urinary and genital systems, such as inflammation or enlargement of the prostate, inflammation of the bladder, urinary stones, and abnormal labor or birthing process, Chronic constipation, presence of sac-like protrusions in the intestine, rectal or anal tumors, or deviation of the rectum from its usual position','One should watch out for recurrences of prolapsed tissue, especially if the underlying cause was not eliminated. Watch the site in which the dog had surgery for the first five to seven days, as there is a possibility of splitting and reopening, especially when the dog defecates. After surgery, there is also a chance that your dog may lose control over its bladder and bowel, and have involuntary "accidents." Your pet may be just as disturbed as you when there is an "accident." Making sure your dog has plenty of opportunities to go outside may help avoid any accidents or related stress.');

Immediate hospitalization and intervention is often necessary, either to prevent death (devitalization) of tissue or to treat the problem. Intravenous fluid and electrolyte therapy may be necessary in these patients. Antibiotic therapy should be instituted at once. If the individual is a valuable breeding animal, and the prolapsed tissue appears to be healthy and not devitalized, an attempt can be made to save and replace the uterus, thoroughly cleansing the tissue, and manually replacing it. If the damage is extensive, or this animal will not be bred in the future, there is no doubt that an ovariohysterectomy (spay) is recommended. Occasionally, a partial uterine amputation can be performed, leaving the viable portion of uterus intact, allowing for breeding in the future. This is not recommended in most cases.','Baseline tests, to include a complete blood count (CBC), biochemical profile, and urinalysis, are usually within normal limits. Occasionally, in advanced cases or in patients who have infection throughout the body (sepsis), there can be multiple abnormalities that need to be addressed immediately.

The genetic relationship between retinal folds and the other 2 forms of dysplasia is unknown at this time. Some ophthalmologists suggest that a mature dog with persistent retinal foldsmay produce more severe forms of the disease in their offspring, secondary to the dog being a carrier of the gene for the more severe forms of dysplasia.  What appear to be folds on exam can sometimes be dysplasia, so a maturedog with folds or dysplasia should not pass a CERF exam.

The retinal tissue undergoes changes until the eye is fully developed at the age of one year. Dysplasia is defined as abnormal growth or development. Retinal dysplasia forms when the 2 developmental layers of. the retina do not unite properly.  It can involve both eyes or one, but the inherited form is almost always bilateral. It can occur anytime during eye development, from pregnancy to one year of age.','Retinal dysplasia is not a progressive disease, but it will continue to develop until the retinas are mature at around. one year of age. To allow the retinas time to mature, the earliest age for a CERF screening for this disease is 6 months, yet closer to one year is recommended by Dr. Kirk Gelatt at which time a definite diagnosis can be. established. If you suspect one of your puppies has visual impairment, seek an ophthalmology exam immediately. Signs would include frequently bumping into objects, less activity, and possibly timid or fearful.','As responsible bichon frise breeders, we need to be aware of retinal dysplasia and stop the progression of this disease in our breed while the incidence is low. We can accomplish this by completing the initial CERF exam near the age of one year and not breeding bichons with persistent retinal folds or retinal dysplasia. In the past, some bichon breeders were advised that there is no reason to CERF until the age of 2 years, since the age of onset of the bichon cataract is 1.5-2 years.

Besides, knowing that your bichon has retinal dysplasia would be beneficial before spending the time and money to complete its championship.

Treatment is usually directed at the underlying cause of the retinal detachment. The detachment itself is very difficult to treat. Depending on the physical condition of the patient, treatment options may include outpatient care or may necessitate hospitalization. If the detachment is due to high blood pressure, then medications are instituted to lower the blood pressure. As the blood pressure is being controlled, systemic anti-inflammatory medications may be used to try to decrease the damage done to the retina. Specific therapy for the underlying condition can include the following, depending upon the underlying cause: Antibiotic and anti-fungal therapy for certain infections, Systemic corticosteroids for immune diseases, Chemotherapy for leukemias and other cancers, Vitamin K therapy and blood transfusions for clotting problems, Intravenous fluids for hyperviscosity and other circulatory disorders, Administration of antidotes for antifreeze toxicity, Surgical removal of severely injured eyes or eyes with tumors, Some types of retinal detachments are not treatable. Examples include the congenital detachments and detachments associated with degeneration of the retina. Surgery or laser therapy may be tried for partial detachments that arise after intraocular surgery, or for retinal tears that occur in shih tzus and other dogs.','A complete history and physical examination of your dog are important to document the onset and progression of any eye signs and systemic abnormalities. A thorough ophthalmic examination is indicated. Some retinal detachments are easily identified, while others can be difficult to see. Your veterinarian may refer your dog to a veterinary ophthalmologist for further evaluation using specialized instrumentation. Once a retinal detachment is diagnosed in your dog, then an extensive search is required to identify any underlying diseases. Tests to be considered include the following: Complete blood count (CBC), Biochemical profile, Urinalysis, Fecal flotation, Measure of arterial blood pressure, Thyroid hormone assays, Blood clotting tests, X-rays of the chest and abdomen, Blood tests for infectious diseases, Serum protein assays, especially separating and characterizing proteins (electrophoresis), Ocular ultrasound. Possibly a heart and/or abdominal ultrasound, Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tap, Possibly collection of fluid from the vitreous chamber in blind eyes suspected to be infected','Blindness or reduced vision. The severity of vision loss is related to the extent of retinal detachment. If only one eye is affected, the animal’s behavior may be normal. The onset of blindness can be gradual or rapid. In dogs with detachments due to immune diseases or infections, the onset of blindness is usually very rapid (within 1 to 3 days) and often involves both eyes. Dilated pupils with slow or no pupillary light reflex. Dilation of the pupils is one of the first and most obvious signs of retinal detachment. The pupil will open up as the eye loses its sight. Possibly visible hemorrhage or discoloration of the front part of the eye. If blood from the back of the eye moves forward, or if the front portion of the eye becomes inflamed, then the appearance of the eye may become altered.','Retinal detachments can occur in one or both eyes. The age of onset varies widely and depends upon the underlying cause or ocular problem.Congenital Causes. It is uncommon for dogs to be born with retinal detachments, but sometimes detachments can develop in the first few months of life. These types of detachments are usually associated with severe, inherited birth defects of the eye, such as the following: Severe retinal dysplasia or folding of the retina; sometimes also associated with skeletal deformities in large breed dogs. Collie eye anomaly with defects of the retina, choroid, and sclera in the back of the eye. Multiple ocular defects caused by poor nutrition, exposure to radiation, or other serious infections during the pregnancy. Inherited multiple ocular defects, especially those associated with excessive white coat coloring. Circulatory Causes. High blood pressure (systemic hypertension) is a potential cause of retinal detachments in older dogs. High blood pressure results in fluid leakage and bleeding from blood vessels of the retina and under the retina. As fluid accumulates under the retina, the retina is pushed away from the underlying pigmented epithelium and a detachment develops. The most common causes of hypertension in older dogs are chronic kidney disease and hyperadrenocorticism, which is too much steroid hormone output from the adrenal gland. Rare causes include tumors of the adrenal glands and hyperthyroidism, which is too much hormone output from the thyroid gland. Hyperviscosity syndrome can also cause retinal detachments. With hyperviscosity syndrome there is too much circulating protein in the blood and the blood becomes very thick. It causes the blood to act almost like sludge in the small blood vessels, and they can rupture or leak. Diseases that cause overproduction of protein in the blood usually involve tumors of the white blood cells that make serum proteins, such as lymphoma or multiple myeloma. Blood can also become too thick and cause circulatory problems within the retina when there are increased numbers of cells in the blood. This can occur with overproduction of white blood cells (leukemias), overproduction of red blood cells (polycythemia), and excessive blood transfusion. Poor clotting of the blood can result in hemorrhaging from the retinal or choroidal blood vessels and possible retinal detachment. Disorders that affect blood clotting include decreased numbers of platelets in the blood, inherited clotting disorders (hemophilia), decreased vitamin K levels in the body, liver disease, leukemia, and other cancers of the bone marrow. Infectious Causes. Any infection that causes inflammation of the retina or underlying choroid can potentially cause a retinal detachment. Examples include fungal infections such as blastomycosis, histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis and coccidiodomycosis; parasitic infestations such as larval migrans; infection with the blue-green algae called protothecosis; and certain bacterial infections, such as infections of the blood (septicemia). Immune-mediated/inflammatory Causes. Uveodermatologic syndrome, which is a rare disease of Oriental breeds of dogs and Arctic sled dogs, can cause retinal detachments. In this bizarre disease the darkly pigmented tissues of the body (skin, hair, eyes, lips) are attacked by the immune system and the pigment disappears. Other immune causes of inflammation of the retina and choroid, especially in large breed dogs, can result in retinal detachments. Systemic lupus erythematosus, which is an immune disorder that targets multiple organs (skin, kidneys, eyes), can rarely cause retinal detachments. Degenerative Causes. In the final stages of retinal degeneration a detachment may develop. Retinal degeneration occurs as an inherited condition in many breeds of dogs. See related article on Progressive Retinal Degeneration in dogs. Retinal detachments may sometimes be seen in cases of chronic glaucoma, after the retina has deteriorated. Retinal detachments may also be a long-term complication of surgery performed within the eye, such as after cataract extraction and removal of luxated (dislocated) lenses. The shih tzu dog has an inherited tendency to develop retinal tears that can then progress to retinal detachments. The underlying mechanism of this disorder is unknown. Toxic Causes. Ingestion of antifreeze (ethylene glycol) rarely causes retinal detachments. Reactions to drugs such as sulfa products may cause enough fluid accumulation under the retina to produce a detachment. Cancerous Causes. Any tumor that arises in the retina or choroid, or that spreads to these tissues from another location (metastatic cancer) can cause a retinal detachment. Some examples of these tumors include lymphosarcoma, melanoma, and metastatic tumors from the kidney, mammary glands and other organs. Rarely, tumors of the optic nerve (nerve that leads from the retina to the brain) can cause a retinal detachment. Traumatic Causes. Penetrating injury or foreign body. Blunt trauma with inflammation or hemorrhage','Pets with recent onset of blindness should be evaluated by your veterinarian as soon as possible. Minimize stress and injury by confining your pet to a safe area until the cause of the problem is determined.  Administer all medication and return for follow-up examinations as directed by your veterinarian. Prognosis for return of vision is poor to guarded. Although some retinas reattach once therapy has been started, return of vision is uncertain. Because the detachment may also signify the presence of a serious illness in the dog, the prognosis for the dog’s overall health may also be poor to guarded.  In general, high blood pressure is a very treatable disease and dogs may remain in reasonably good health. They may be blind, however. In the event that vision cannot be saved, understand that such vision loss is not life threatening and the vast majority of dogs adjust very well to their blindness.  Some of the immune diseases also respond favorably to therapy and the retinas may reattach. In these cases, therapy must often be continued for long periods of time to control the disease. Other diseases may not respond to therapy as well, and the life of the dog may be shortened.  Retinal detachments caused by fungal infections may not respond well to treatment because the drugs may not get into the eye effectively. Although the drugs may cure the disease elsewhere in the body, the eye may be lost.  Supervision of irreversibly blind dogs is important: They should only be allowed outside on a leash, or in a confined area under direct supervision. Place barriers across stair, over hot tubs and around pools. Restrict activity on balconies so that small dogs cannot fall through the space between the guardrails and large dogs cannot unwittingly jump off the balcony. Fence open decks so that the dog cannot fall off. Establish a known location for the food and water bowls and guide your pet to them if necessary.

Skin fold dermatitis, a skin infection between the folds of skin, can be treated with antibiotics by mouth or inside the skin folds along with daily cleaning of the skin folds. Cleaning involves special shampoos, antiseptics, baths or medicated wipes. Ironically, while cleaning the skin fold helps treat the infection, it can also make it worse. The reason is that bacteria love the environment inside the skin fold because it is dark, warm and moist. Therefore, any liquid or ointment placed inside the skin fold maintains the moisture level.

If the condition is not severe, your dog may be treated on an outpatient basis, especially if the shoulder joint problem was found early. With bicipital tenosynovitis (inflammation of the tendon and surrounding sheath of the biceps tendon), there is a 50-75 percent chance of success with medical treatment. Surgery is usually required when there is evidence of long-term (chronic) changes and failure to response to non-invasive medical management. Rupture of the tendon of the biceps muscle generally requires surgery. Mineralization of the tendon of the shoulder muscle may be an incidental finding. This condition may require surgery after excluding other causes of lameness and attempting medical treatment. Forcible separation (avulsion) or fracture of the tendon of the shoulder muscle often requires surgery because of persistent bone-fragment irritation of the tendon. Deterioration and scarring of the shoulder muscle requires surgery. Ice packing (known as cryotherapy) immediately following surgery can help to reduce inflammation and swelling at the surgical site. It will need to be performed five to ten minutes every eight hours for three to five days after surgery, or as directed by your dog''s veterinarian. Regional massage and range-of-motion exercises can improve flexibility and decrease loss of muscle mass (muscle atrophy) after the initial recovery period. Your veterinarian will advise you on when you should begin physical therapy with your dog. Medical treatment will require strict confinement for four to six weeks. Following surgery, how much activity your dog can participate in depends on the procedure performed; your pet''s veterinarian will provide instructions regarding postoperative activity and restrictions. It is important to follow your veterinarian''s recovery protocols closely to avoid a recurrence or worsening of your dog''s physical health. A premature return to normal activity will likely worsen signs and lead to a long-term (chronic) condition. Weight control will be a part of your dog''s long term care as well, so that excess pressure on the limb does not aggravate the tendons. Depending on your dog''s starting weight, your veterinarian may recommend a strict diet for weight loss, or merely a maintenance diet to prevent weight gain.','X-rays will be needed to determine what is wrong with the shoulder. Ultrasound and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may help identify muscle injuries, bicipital tenosynovitis, and rupture of the biceps tendon. It is also useful for determining the location of calcium densities near the intertubercular groove, where the long head of the biceps meets the upper part of the humerus. A joint tap and analysis of fluid from the joint will help identify intra-articular (within the joint) disease. An arthroscopic exploration of the shoulder joint will help diagnose bicipital tenosynovitis, rupture of the biceps tendon, and will confirm or rule out intra-articular disease. This method of diagnostics is performed using an arthroscope, a specially equipped endoscope, which is a tubular device that can be inserted into the joint in order to remove fluid, tissue, or other material for analysis. It includes a camera for visual inspection, and can be outfitted with tools for removal of samples, and for treating the cavity or internal structure.','Symptoms will depend on the severity and long-term nature of the disease, A decrease in muscle mass is a consistent finding for all conditions, Bicipital tenosynovitis (an inflammation of the tendon and surrounding sheath of the biceps tendon – at the front of the shoulder blade), Onset is usually subtle, Often of several months’ duration, Trauma to the limb or shoulder may be the inciting cause, Subtle, intermittent lameness that worsens with exercise, Short and limited swing-phase of gait owing to pain on extension and flexion of the shoulder, Pain inconsistently demonstrated on manipulation of shoulder, Rupture of the tendon of the biceps brachii muscle (upper limb), Signs similar to bicipital tenosynovitis, May have sudden (acute) onset due to a known traumatic event, Usually subtle, long-term (chronic) lameness that worsens with exercise, Mineralization of the tendon of the supraspinatus (shoulder joint) muscle — onset is usually subtle.

Medically managed bicipital tenosynovitis is often successful after one or two treatments in 50-75 percent of cases, with no long-term (chronic) changes. Surgically treated bicipital tenosynovitis has good to excellent results in 90 percent of cases. Recovery will need to be taken slow, with gradual increases of physical movement. Full function may take two to eight months. Surgically treated rupture of the tendon of the biceps muscle has a good to excellent prognosis; more than 85 percent of patients show improved return to function. Surgically treated mineralization of the tendon of the supraspinatus muscle has a good to excellent prognosis; recurrence is possible, but uncommon.

Such management would include the use of anti-inflammatory drugs such as deracoxib or aspirin; nutraceuticals, such as Cosequin or Adequan; regular, moderate exercise programs and appropriate weight control. Surgical management would include procedures to remove damaged or fragmented pieces of cartilage, either directly by making an incision to open the joint or by arthroscopy. Cutting the ulna, one of the three bones that form the elbow joint, thereby avoiding direct intervention with the joint itself, can treat one form of elbow dysplasia. Surgery is most effective in younger dogs, before arthritis develops. It usually improves function but will not prevent some arthritis from developing in the dysplastic elbow joint.','Diagnostic tests needed to recognize elbow dysplasia, and identify or exclude other diseases, include: A complete medical history and physical examination. Your veterinarian will walk and trot your dog, looking for front leg lameness. The lameness may be present in both front legs, producing a stiff gait and shortened stride. Pain may be produced on elbow flexion, with or without inward rotation of the paw or elbow extension. Radiographs of the elbow should be taken, with several different views in order to identify even subtle abnormalities. Occasionally CT scans are needed for diagnosis. Both elbows should be examined as the problem often affects both right and left elbow joints.','A sudden or gradual onset front leg lameness. Morning stiffness. Stiffness after a period of rest',NULL,'After surgery, the leg is usually placed in a soft padded bandage for two weeks after which time stitches are removed. For the first 4 to 6 weeks after surgery, exercise is restricted. This can be difficult to enforce in young active puppies. After this time your pet can undergo a gradual increase in exercise. In some cases, intermittent lameness may persist despite surgery. It is usually mild and may improve with medical management. The exact cause of elbow dysplasia remains unknown, but it is almost certainly multifactorial, meaning that the abnormal development of your dog’s elbow joint occurs because of a combination of genetic, growth rate, nutritional, hormonal and traumatic factors. Of these contributing factors, genetics and nutrition are probably the easiest to consider in terms of prevention of elbow dysplasia. When selecting a pedigree breed known to have a predisposition for elbow dysplasia, it would be helpful to know whether the parents had evidence of elbow dysplasia, or not. For this reason, a scoring scheme for elbow dysplasia has been set up by the Orthopedic Foundation For Animals (OFA). Dogs can be registered when they are over 24 months of age by submitting elbow X-rays to the OFA. They will be evaluated and scored as being normal or abnormal. Abnormal elbows will be graded from I through III, depending on increasing severity of change. This registry is described as “closed” in that it gives out information only on normal dogs to parties other than the breeder (owner). Clearly, it is preferable to purchase a puppy where the sire and the dam have been found to have certified, normal elbows. An “open” registry for elbow dysplasia to consider is the Institute for Genetic Disease Control at Davis, California. Certain puppy diets have a high protein content that has been cited as a possible reason for bony developmental abnormalities such as elbow dysplasia. Obviously not all puppies on such diets get elbow problems. Monitor your pet’s rate of growth by measuring weight and height. If your dog seems to be growing too fast, it may be advisable to change the diet to a lower-protein, adult diet, after consultation with your veterinarian. Despite medical and surgical intervention, dogs with dysplastic elbows will go on to develop some degree of elbow arthritis. However, early diagnosis and treatment may help to minimize this problem.

If you try a home treatment, you may not have much luck as the underlying issue often remains. Cysts often will not disappear unless the entire sac is removed. This is something that only a veterinarian can do through surgery, which is only recommended when cysts recur, are prone to infections, or impair your dog''s quality of life. Consult with your vet for the best option. Also, cysts don''t like to stay empty. Even when they rupture or are drained, they tend to fill up again and you''re soon back to where you started. However, there are some instances where cysts have gone away on their own and where home remedies have worked. In general if it''s at all an option and if the cyst doesn''t appear to be bothering the dog, it''s better to leave it alone.','Fine Needle Aspiration. A fine needle aspiration may help reveal the type of lump your dog has, but it''s not as accurate as a tissue biopsy (discussed below). In this procedure, a needle is used to draw a sample of cells. The collected material is then placed on a glass slide and examined in the hospital or sent off to a pathologist for cytology. Generally, if the lump deflates and exudes a cheesy gray, brown, or yellowish material once the needle is inserted, it is likely (though not definitively) a cyst. This is not a sure-fire diagnosis method, however, since lumps are often not homogeneous (the same throughout). It''s comparable to inserting a straw into a mixed berry and peach pie covered by a tea towel. When you insert the straw and draw a sample to examine, you may not be sure what type of pie it is. If you collected some peaches, you might think it''s a peach pie. If you got just crust and berry sauce, you might think it was something else. Tissue Biopsy. Another, more accurate way to rule out cancer is through tissue biopsy. In this case, the procedure is more expensive and invasive, but the results are also more accurate. For a tissue biopsy, your dog will need a local anesthetic as the vet will remove a piece of the lump so it can be sent to histopathology and analyzed. If the lump is found to be malignant, your dog will need to have it totally removed. Excisional Biopsy. For this procedure, your dog will go straight to surgery to have the entire lump removed. This is the most costly option, but it''s also the best to get a proper diagnosis as the whole lump is sent to pathology. Another advantage is that the entire mass will be gone, which is good if it was impairing movement or bothering the dog. The main disadvantage is that it''s the most invasive option and the dog will be under total anesthesia. Since the operating vet doesn''t know what the lump is, he may be removing something benign. Of course, there are no black-and-white rules when it comes to the best method for diagnosis. Depending on where the lump is, its size, and appearance, the vet may take a more conservative or drastic approach.','The first sign of a sebaceous cyst is usually noticing a lump or a bump that was not there on your dog before. Sebaceous cysts do not usually cause the dog any pain. In fact, owners find them to be more of a nuisance because they are an eyesore. At times, however, the cysts can become bothersome, interfering with movement or getting infected. Sometimes the buildup of oily matter is so great that the cyst ruptures. In that case, it''s a good idea to check for signs of infection at least two or three times every day.

In dogs, however, surgery has a high mortality rate and is not considered a viable treatment option at this time. In the absence of definitive correction through surgery, tetralogy of Fallot is managed by giving daily medication at home to reduce the impact of sympathetic activity ("adrenaline rushes") on the heart, which can be especially strenuous on sick hearts like those with tetralogy of Fallot. These medications are called beta-blockers and include such prescription medications as atenolol, metoprolol, or carvedilol. Some dogs with tetralogy of Fallot develop a very high red blood cell count, which further hampers adequate tissue oxygenation. In these dogs, periodic phlebotomy (bloodletting) may restore a more normal viscosity or thickness to the blood, and thus improve circulation, or a medication to reduce red blood cell formation in the body (hydroxyurea) may be prescribed for this purpose. Regardless, dogs with tetralogy of Fallot that require medications need to have regular medical checkups, often every few months.','Puppies with severe cases of this disorder may be weak and may grow poorly, and such symptoms are initial clues to a veterinarian that tetralogy of Fallot may be present. On closer physical examination, a veterinarian may identify cyanosis, and a heart murmur is apparent on listening to the heart with a stethoscope in all cases of tetralogy of Fallot. Definitive confirmation comes with thoracic radiographs (X-rays of the chest) and an echocardiogram (ultrasound of the heart; cardiac sonogram), both of which are noninvasive tests that can be performed without sedation in a majority of dogs.','As with other heart defects, the presence of symptoms and overall impact of tetralogy of Fallot depends on the severity of the defect.

More serious cases are common, where puppies with this combination of defects experience weakness, failure to thrive and grow, a reduced tolerance for exercise, and general cyanosis (blue-grey coloration of the mucous membranes of the mouth and eyes, instead of the normal pale pink).

None of these forms of treatment is useful (and some may be detrimental) if overt symptoms/signs referable to the VSD have not yet occurred. Two surgical options exist but are used very seldom. Where a large VSD has been identified, but before right-to-left shunting has developed, pulmonary artery banding can be done to decrease the blood flow across the defect, thereby reducing the circulatory overload on the lungs and the left heart.Another procedure involves actual repair of the defect, via open-heart surgery. This procedure is performed in fewer than 10 veterinary centers worldwide and carries a high risk; a veterinarian can help determine whether an individual dog is a suitable candidate for either of these procedures.','Often, as with most heart defects, the first indication of a problem is when the veterinarian hears a heart murmur during a puppy''s routine physical examination. Sometimes there is exercise intolerance or respiratory difficulty, but this is usually in an older dog or a young pup with a large defect. It is important to note that normal healthy puppies without VSDs may sometimes have heart murmurs too, for a few weeks as they are growing up. Therefore, if a veterinarian identifies a heart murmur, the best course of action may be to wait 2-3 weeks and recheck (because "innocent" murmurs that puppies outgrow should be gone after 2-3 weeks, whereas the murmur of a VSD would persist) or simply to have tests to confirm whether a VSD is present. Diagnostic tests that are very helpful in this regard include thoracic radiographs (chest x-rays) and a cardiac ulstrosund (sonogram of the heart, echocardiogram). If a VSD is identified, then the degree of severity and impact can be pinpointed, and the long-term implications discussed. A VSD may produce no strain on the heart at all (many people have VSDs and live normal lives with them) whereas other VSDs may become life-shortening, depending on the extent of the defect identified with tests.','The extent to which a dog will be affected by this defect depends on the size and location of the VSD inside the heart. Many dogs with VSDs have small defects that may not cause any problems and are entirely compatible with a normal lifespan. Interestingly with VSD, the dogs with the smallest, least harmful defects are often the dogs with the loudest -not softest- heart murmurs. This means that having a loud heart murmur turn up during a veterinary exam, when the heart is checked (ausculted) using a stethoscope, is not automatically a serious problem. Rather, a heart murmur should be investigated further to determine whether a VSD is present (see below), and if so, how severe the condition is. With larger VSDs, the circulation is disrupted in a way that forces the heart to work much harder. In some individuals this can be tolerated without causing symptoms for a long time (months to years) but in others, life-threatening symptoms are possible even at an early age. Signs or symptoms associated with this disorder may develop within months or years, depending on the size of the defect, and they include shortness of breath and exercise intolerance. Rarely, collapse and cardiac arrest may occur in a dog with a VSD, especially if the defect is large and the dog is physically overactive. A veterinarian can monitor the condition of the VSD and the heart in an affected dog and recommend treatment, or consultation with a veterinary cardiologist, as required. Treatment may include medications to support the heart and to reduce congestion in the lungs, a special diet, and exercise restriction, but unlike in humans, repair of the defect is rarely performed because it would usually require open-heart surgery. Among puppies with large VSDs, it is probable that many die early, before 8 weeks of age or before they are examined by a veterinarian. For this reason, stillborn puppies or pups that die very young (before weaning) should be autopsied, because the assumption of "fading puppy" or "runt of the litter" as the cause of death often misses the point: the cause of death may have been a severe heart malformation like a large VSD, and knowing whether or not this is the case can be vital for future breeding decisions.',NULL,'Affected pups and their parents (assumed to be carriers) should not be bred.

If your dog requires surgery, your veterinarian may recommend a transfusion pre-operatively as a precaution, depending on the severity of the bleeding disorder, and the type of surgery.Thyroid supplements may help to control bleeding, if your veterinarian determines that your dog is hypothyroid.','Because the severity of bleeding with von Willebrand''s disease is quite variable, often the disease is not diagnosed until the dog is 3 to 5 years old. Your veterinarian may suspect vWD because of a history of abnormal bleeding in your dog, such as unexplained nosebleeds, or there may be heavy bleeding during surgery. Stillbirths or pups that die shortly after birth ("fading puppies") may be a result of both parents being carriers of the gene for von Willebrand''s disease.There are specialized tests available to make the diagnosis of von Willebrand''s disease. One is a genetic test and the other measures blood levels of von Willebrand factor.','Although many dogs are affected by vWD, only a small proportion have severe problems. Dogs with vWD are prone to nose bleeds, bleeding from the gums, and prolonged bleeding during heat or after whelping. There may be prolonged bleeding from the umbilical cord at birth or when your pup sheds its baby teeth. Excessive bleeding after surgery or trauma is common, and may be the first sign of this condition in your dog. You may see blood in your dog''s urine or stool. Most dogs with vWD can lead normal lives, with occasional bleeding episodes that may go unnoticed or can be treated appropriately. Other illnesses, or physical or emotional stress, may worsen bleeding episodes. In affected dogs, it is best to consult your veterinarian before using any over-the-counter medications. Drugs such as aspirin, for example, alter the function of platelets and should be avoided in dogs with bleeding disorders.',NULL,'The trait for von Willebrand''s disease is widespread, particularly in Doberman pinschers, but also in several other breeds. An accurate genetic test has been developed for several breeds - testing can reliably identify dogs with vWD, dogs that are carriers, or dogs that are clear (see vetGen for information on testing and the breeds in which it is available).In breeds where specific genetic tests are not yet available, carriers of the trait can still be identified through the blood test for von Willebrand factor. These dogs have reduced levels of vWF (25 to 60 per cent) but do not have bleeding problems. Levels vary with age and between breeds. Where a bleeding disorder has been identified, breeders are advised to test breeding stock. Dogs with von Willebrand''s disease and those who are carriers should not be used for breeding.');

Whether overt symptoms are present or not, arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy is a nonpainful type of heart condition that tends to worsen over time.  Daily oral medications can be given at home to reduce the frequency and severity of symptoms if they are occurring, and dogs may live well for weeks, months, or occasionally years with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy when they respond well to medications.',NULL,'Boxers with arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy should not be bred.  Current standards include screening potential breeding stock using Holter monitoring; a specific cutoff remains elusive, but generally dog with <100 PVCs/24 hours are considered fit to breed and dogs with >1000 PVCs/24 hrs should not be bred.  The intermittent and highly variable nature of PVC occurence means that annual follow-up of beeding animals is very important, as is close evaluation of offspring if an adult later is found to have developed arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy after initially having been cleared on earlier screening.');
INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(336,'brachycephalic syndrome','1551','Brachycephalic syndrome in dogs is when your dog has a shortened skull in comparison to other breeds. Effects of this condition can include breathing difficulties, difficulties with exercise, and overheating to name a few concerns, and is breed specific mostly.','Medical treatment (oxygen therapy, corticosteroids) can be used for short term relief of airway inflammation. Surgery is required where severe anatomic faults interfere with breathing. Most commonly this involves removal of some of the excess fleshy soft palate, and widening of air passages at the nostrils. It is important to keep your dog from becoming overweight, as this will worsen his or her respiratory difficulties in the long run.','These problems are usually evident from a young age. If your dog has respiratory difficulties, your veterinarian may discuss this syndrome with you as part of a regular visit, or you may bring your dog in because of an episode such as collapsing after exercise. Because some changes in anatomy are common to all dogs of these breeds, diagnosis is really a question of the degree of abnormality. The overlong soft palate is best examined under general anesthesia, and so, because of the associated risks, your vet will most likely ask your permission in advance to surgically correct it at the same time if necessary. Neutering can often be performed at the same time. ','Problems associated with this syndrome range in severity, with most brachycephalic dogs snuffling and snorting to some degree. Some will have no further difficulties, but many will have problems such as increasingly noisy breathing, coughing and gagging, fainting or collapsing episodes, and a decreased tolerance for exercise (ie. they tire easily). Over the long term, this also puts an increased strain on the heart. Some dogs, such as English bulldogs, may have frequent episodes of sleep-disordered breathing. Overheating is especially dangerous in these breeds, because increased panting (the normal mechanism for cooling in dogs) can cause further swelling and narrowing of the already constricted airways, which will increase your dog''s anxiety.  Excitement, exercise, or warm weather (and especially a combination of these factors) can trigger this vicious cycle.  These dogs can also have gastrointestinal problems, because of difficulties coordinating swallowing when they are working so hard at breathing. This can result in vomiting ar gagging because of swallowing so much air, or aspiration pneumonia, because of breathing in saliva or food particles. All dogs of these breeds have an increased risk associated with sedation and anesthesia, for which your veterinarian will take extra precautions.',NULL,'This syndrome is directly related to the conformation or standards for these breeds. Although so common as to be accepted as normal for brachycephalics, BAOS causes serious physical problems and discomfort for individual dogs.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(349,'Dilated cardiomyopathy','162','Dilated cardiomyopathy is the most common type in the dog, and is the subject of all the sections, below.','Treatment for dilated cardiomyopathy consists of medications given one or more times a day. Initially, if severe symptoms are observed, the medications may need to be given in teh hospital for the first 1-3 days, where some of the medications can be given by injection. Ultimately, home treatment consists of giving the medications orally, avoiding strenuous exercise, avoiding salty foods or treats, and monitoring for any return of symptoms that woud prompt a recheck visit and adjustment of medications. Commonly-used medications include a diuretic such as furosemide (Lasix), spironolactone, or torsemide (Demadex); a type of medication that vasodilates, or decreases the resistance to outflow of blood from the heart, thereby easing the heart''s workload (ACE inhibitors such as enalapril [Enacard], benazepril [Fortekor], ramipril [Vasotop], or imidapril [Prilium]); digitalis (digoxin, Lanoxin); and inodilators such as pimobendan (Vetmedin). It is common for dogs to need to be on all 4 of these classes of medications, which demonstrates that close attention and medication administration at home is essential, and that treatment may become costly, especially in the largest breeds (since the amount of medication given is based on body weight). Dogs that respond well to medications usually do so within days or 1-2 weeks of starting treatment, and show an often dramatic improvement in their energy level, appetite and overall demeanour. Decisions about initiating (and later, adjusting) treatment are based on several factors: whether the dog is showing symptoms such as weakness or collapse, whether arrhythmias are seen on the electrocardiogram, and whether there is fluid retention in the tissues due to disruption of the circulation. There is no surgery to correct dilated cardiomyopathy in dogs.','As stated above, the test of choice for confirming dilated cardiomyopathy is an echocardiogram: an ultrasound of the heart. The echocardiogram cannot rely only on left ventricular fractional shortening for providing the diagnosis; it must include absolute left ventricular dimensions and, if there is any uncertainty (given the large area of overlap between normal athletic hearts and early dilated cardiomyopathy), it needs to include left ventricular volume calculations using Simpson''s method of disks. This is usually best accomplished by a veterinary cardiologist, and general practitioner veterinarians can refer their patients to these specialists (directories are available at www.acvim.org and www.ecvim-ca.org for North America and Europe, respectively). Thoracic radiographs (X-rays of the chest) are appropriate in all suspected cases of dilated cardiomyopathy. In affected dogs, an enlarged heart silhouette is a common abnormal finding, and there may be evidence of fluid retention within the lung tissue (pulmonary edema) or surrounding and collapsing the lungs (pleural effusion). An electrocardiogram (ECG, EKG) may be performed if an irregular heartbeat, or arrhythmia, is detected by the veterinarian when listening with the stethoscope. If dilated cardiomyopathy is suspected and results from all routine diagnostic tests are normal, a 24 hour ambulatory electrocardiogram (Holter monitor) is often recommended. The unobtrusive monitor is worn by the dog during normal daily activities, and it records irregular heart rhythms. When dilated cardiomyopathy is confirmed in a dog, routine blood and urine tests (complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, urinalysis) are run prior to beginning medications, in order to identify any other problems that could interfere with treatment, and to establish a baseline for future comparison when monitoring the effects of medications.','Dilated cardiomyopathy is a potentially severe, debilitating, but painless, disease of adult dogs (typically between 5 and 10 years of age). Overall, it almost always worsens over time, beginning with an asymptomatic period where dogs (and their families/breeders) have no way of suspecting that it exists: there are no symptoms or detectable abnormalities. This asymptomatic period, where the condition is referred to as &quot;occult dilated cardiomyopathy&quot; because it remains hidden, can last for years. Indeed, one of the reasons dilated cardiomyopathy spreads so widely within breeds is that it may only be detected long after a dog''s breeding career is underway and the condition has been passed on to subsequent generations. Dilated cardiomyopathy usually is first suspected when symptoms emerge, including respiratory difficulty (even severe breathlessness/unrelenting gasping for air), loss of appetite, sudden decrease in willingness or ability to exercise, weakness, episodes of collapse, and/or a bloated, pot-bellied abdomen. Prior to the appearance of such symptoms, no medication has been convincingly shown to help prolong quality of life or lifespan. Once these kinds of symptoms occur, however, medications (given at home, daily, as oral tablets or capsules) are indispensable for survival. When Doberman dogs develop these symptoms, the outlook may be very serious: even with medication, approximately one-third may not survive for more than a few days; about one-third improve and feel well for several weeks before worsening despite medication and either beign euthanized or dying; and the remaining one-third do well for months to a year or more. In addition to the symptoms outlined above, a distinctive feature of this disorder in Doberman pinschers and boxers is that abnormal heart rhythms may originate in the heart and can be quite serious. These arrhythmias (atrial fibrillation, ventricular tachycardia) can worsen over time and may cause the heartbeat to be unstable. This is perhaps the most suddenly devastating aspect of dilated cardiomyopathy: that it can cause immediate, collapse (like a person who has a heart attack) and that a dog may not survive. When a dog is suspected of having dilated cardiomyopathy, the most important first step is confirmation, because this heart disorder can be so serious. An echocardiogram (also called ultrasound of the heart or cardiac sonogram) should be performed by a board-certified veterinary cardiologist. This painless, noninvasive procedure lets the cardiologist examine the heart in real time, and assess its structure and function. The abnormality of dilated cardiomyopathy may be subtle, and there is much overlap between normal and early dilated cardiomyopathy. For this reason, a skilled specialist should be consulted. If dilated cardiomyopathy is confirmed, treatment may or may not be necessary depending on the degree/stage of the problem. The outlook depends on findings obtained in diagnostic tests (see below).',NULL,'Affected individuals and their parents should not be used for breeding. Siblings should only be used after careful screening. How can cardiomyopathy be controlled? There are promising ways to approach the control of this disease. Although signs of heart failure are often not evident until middle or older age, abnormalities on the electrocardiogram are often apparent earlier. In affected breeds with a family history of cardiomyopathy and in ALL Doberman pinschers, breeding animals should be evaluated yearly for evidence of cardiac arryhthmias, using echocardiography with left ventricular volume measurement whenever possible, or an ambulatory (Holter) monitor otherwise.

A dog that experiences the occasional mild seizure probably needs no treatment other than watchfulness on the part of the owner. Grand mal seizures or status epilepticus, at the other extreme, require emergency medical treatment to sedate or anesthetize the dog, and to prevent the brain damage associated with prolonged seizure activity. Once your veterinarian has determined that your dog has idiopathic epilepsy (ie. no specific cause that can be treated), s/he will likely recommend regular medication to control seizures if they occur more than once a month or in clusters, or if your dog has experienced a grand mal seizure.Phenobarbitalis the drug most commonly used and it is safe, effective and inexpensive. Your veterinarian will work with you to determine the lowest effective dose for your dog. You will be asked to keep careful track of any seizures as well as all drugs given. Blood levels of phenobarbital should be measured periodically, as well as indicators of liver and kidney function. With this monitoring, most dogs with idiopathic epilepsy can lead a normal life. Dosages may need to be adjusted if there is a change in seizure frequency or severity, or if medication is given for another reason. If seizures were initially readily controlled and none has occurred for 6 to 9 months, your veterinarian may very gradually reduce the dosage, and even try discontinuing the use of anticonvulsants. Phenobarbital is not always effective and there are other anticonvulsants that can be tried.Acupunctureis another alternative which may be effective as a first line of treatment, or when use of anticonvulsants fails to control the seizures. A veterinarian specializing in acupuncture should be consulted.','You may not recognize that what has occurred in your dog is a seizure (especially if mild), andyour dog will likely be back to normal by the time you see your veterinarian (except in the case of status epilepticus). Thus your description of the abnormal activity you observed is very important. In order to determine if seizures are due to an underlying disease or are a result of idiopathic inherited epilepsy, your veterinarian will consider the age and breed of your dog and the changes you observed, do various diagnostic tests to rule out other possible causes, and ask questions such as whether your dog may have been exposed to any toxins or possibly received a head injury. The sudden onset of frequent seizures usually indicates an active brain disease, whereas otherwise normal animals that have a few seizures a year likely have idiopathic epilepsy.','The effects of a seizure depend on the part of the brain involved. Typically there is a change in behaviour (eg. confusion, fear, rage), consciousness (the animal may or may not lose consciousness), motor activity (rigid or jerky muscle spasms, or paddling), and autonomic activity (salivation, urination, and defecation). Changes in sensory function may lead to pawing at the face, tail chasing, or biting at part of the body or the air. Seizures may be partial or generalized, and mild or severe (grand mal). A dog experiencing a mild generalized seizure might be confused, show weakness and some muscle tremors, and look to the owner for reassurance. A dog in a grand mal seizure will be unconscious, with rigid or jerking limbs, and involuntary salivation, urination, and defecation. Seizures vary in frequency as well, from very occasional to almost constant. Status epilepticus is a series of seizures in rapid succession, or 1 continuous seizure. This is a medical emergency which requires immediate veterinary attention. It is common for a dog to show a change in behaviour such as hiding or attention-seeking for hours or even days before a seizure (called the prodrome or aura). Abnormal behaviour associated with fatigue, depression, hunger, thirst, or hyperactivity may last for days afterward (post-ictal phase).',NULL,'Dogs that have experienced seizures, and their parents and siblings, should not be used for breeding.

This mostly occurs in the first few days due to kidney, liver, or heart failure, or because of a bleeding problem. The goals of treatment are (1) to slow the destruction of red blood cells (rbcs), and (2) to support the dog while the red blood cell level has a chance to recover. 1) Immunosuppressive therapy with corticosteroids is given to slow rbc destruction, initially at high doses which are gradually tapered over several weeks as rbc levels stabilize and begin to rise again. If rbc levels continue to fall despite steroid therapy, other immunosuppressive drugs may be given. 2) Blood transfusions are needed when the rbc level is critically low. Although the new cells will also be destroyed at the same rate, the transfusion will buy some time for the dog while his/her own blood cell levels are recovering. Dogs that recover from an episode of IMHA may experience future relapses.','Your veterinarian will suspect that your dog is anemic through physical examination. S/he will do some blood tests to find the cause. The diagnosis of IMHA is made by identifying antibodies on the surface of the red blood cells, and ruling out other causes of anemia. For the veterinarian: In IMHA, the immune system destroys rbcs by coating them with immunoglobulin or complement. In most cases of IMHA, the rbcs are coated with incomplete (ie don''t agglutinate rbcs in saline) and warm-type ( ie. react optimally at 35 - 40°C) autoantibodies, mostly IgG. Hemolysis may be intra- or extravascular (mostly in the spleen).Cold antibodies react optimally below 30&deg;C, and are virtually always IgM. These may cause rbc agglutination or hemolysis in the body periphery (ear tips, paws, tail). CBC: The common picture is a highly regenerative anemia, sometimes with a dramatic reactive leukocytosis (neutrophilia and left shift) +/- thrombocytopenia. Hallmarks of regenerative anemia include spherocytosis, autoagglutination, polychromasia, anisocytosis, and reticulocytosis. The absence of reticulocytosis does not preclude a diagnosis of IMHA; this may be due to recent onset (less than 3 days) or destruction of young rbcs in the bone marrow. Bone marrow aspiration should be done if there is a persistent reticulocytopenia, to rule out other primary bone marrow disorders. Biochem. profile: There may be minimal to moderate changes in liver enzyme levels depending on the acuteness and severity of the hemolytic crisis. With intravascular hemolysis, you may see hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria. Saline autoagglutination is diagnostic of IMHA. Mix 1 drop of anticoagulated whole blood with 1 drop physiologic saline on a microscope slide. If enough antibody molecules are present on the rbcs, you will see agglutination (not to be confused with rouleaux formation, which will quickly disperse unlike autoagglutination).The DAT (Direct Antiglobulin Test, or Coomb''s test) is used to detect antibodies on rbcs, when levels are too low to cause autoagglutination. The test is positive in about 60% of cases. The DAT may be negative due to a low number of immunoglobulin molecules on the red cell, problems with the test, immunosuppressive treatment, or an incorrect diagnosis.','IMHA can occur at any age, but is most common in middle-aged female dogs. It may be mild and hardly noticeable, or it may be sudden in onset and severe. Usually the kinds of signs you see are vague - such as poor appetite, weakness, listlessness, lack of energy. You may notice that your dog''s gums are pale, or they may be yellowish due to jaundice as a result of the breakdown of red blood cells. Your pet may have a rapid heart beat and rapid breathing. One form of IMHA(cold agglutinin disease) causes circulation problems in cooler peripheral parts of the body, so the ear or tail tips, or feet may become infected and dark in colour.Reduced levels of circulating red blood cells mean reduced oxygen going to the tissues.

','There is no cure for this condition, but it can often be controlled if treatment is started early. Dietary management is important, using a special intestinal diet with a good quality protein source and without additives. Because it is the hyperactive immune response that leads to tissue damage and interferes with normal intestinal function, treatment is aimed at suppressing that response and decreasing the inflammation present in the gastrointestinal tract. Corticosteroids (prednisone) are used for this purpose, starting at a relatively high dose. Usually your dog''s condition will begin to improve in 1 or 2 weeks and after 1 or 2 months, your veterinarian will begin to gradually reduce the dose to alternate day therapy. Side effects of corticosteroid treatment include an increase in drinking and appetite, and weight gain. These are less of a problem at low doses. There are other immunosuppressive drugs that may be used in combination with corticosteroids, if the response to the latter is unsatisfactory or the side effects are unacceptable.','There are many disorders that cause intermittent diarrhea in dogs, so diagnosis is not simple.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(394,'Portosystemic shunt','817','Portosystemic shunt (PSS) is a birth defect of the circulation in the liver.','The most definitive way to deal with PSS is surgery. The surgeon identifies the path of blood bypassing the liver and closes it, forcing the blood to follow the new, normal course through the liver. This type of surgery is an open-abdominal procedure, meaning general anesthesia is warranted and a period of recovery, typically lasting 1-4 days in the hospital and 2 weeks or so at home, is to be expected. The success rate of surgery is high (&gt;90%) but not perfect; even in the most experienced hands, some dogs with PSS who also have microvascular dysplasia or other circulatory defect through the liver may not tolerate the operation and may need only partial closure of the shunt. Other dogs do not tolerate any correction of PSS and this is only apparent during the operation. To improve the chances of success, surgeons often repair PSS by inserting a device that closes the PSS gradually, over several weeks. Surgeons also will be careful to monitor a dog''s status both before the surgery and during the post-operative period; the liver performs so many essential functions that careful monitoring and medical support, such as with plasma transfusions, antibiotics, or other treatments, are essential. In some cases, PSS may involve a single shunt that is buried deep within the liver tissue: intra-hepatic PSS. These situations are difficult to correct in the manner described above, and a better option in such cases is minimally-invasive occlusion (closure) of the shunt through catheter-based techniques. Briefly, this approach does not involve surgical opening of the abdomen but rather involves a surgeon placing a catheter through a blood vessel in the groin and steering the catheter to the location of the shunt within the liver under fluoroscopic, real-time X-ray guidance. The surgeon can then deploy a device that occludes (blocks) blood flow at that level, redirecting it into the normal path. This is an extremely challenging procedure performed only at certain specialist referral hospitals; discussing this possibility with a general practitioner veterinarians is the first step, followed by referral if the features of the PSS are compatible with this procedure. Finally, many dogs with very mild or no symptoms of PSS, especially if the condition is first identified after 5 years of age, may do well simply by receving oral medications and no surgery at all. To be clear, definitive (surgical) correction is the best treatment, but if the PSS is very minor and it escapes notice until age 5 years or thereafter, there may be more to be gained with a conservative approach and no surgery.','Generally, the diagnosis of PSS is suspected based on a combination of the medical history (such as delayed anesthetic recovery or previous surgery for urolith/urinary tract stone removal), symptoms (such as those described above), and results of laboratory tests. The screening test of choice is a routine laboratory panel (complete blood count, serum biochemistry profile, and urinalysis) with serum bile acids, which is a specific blood test that requires a 12-hour fasting period beforehand and takes 2-3 hours. The confirmatory test of choice is a high-detail abdominal ultrasound examinationby a specialist (radiologist or internist); nuclear scintigraphy (atype of scan) also is highly definitive but is less widely available. Either test is noninvasive and is generally done without sedation. The screening blood test, serum bile acids, is highly accurate, with a nearly 100% ability to detect PSS in dogs that have it. A positive test still requires ultrasound/scan confirmation, because other disorders such as hepatic microvascular dysplasia, which is an incurable, microscopic version of PSS where thousands of small shunts ("shortcuts") cause blood to bypass the liver at the tissue level, may be present instead. Hepatic microvascular dysplasia can only be confirmed with a liver biopsy, so it is routine for dogs that undergo surgery for PSS to also have a liver biopsy, for identifying whether hepatic microvascular dysplasia is also present. This alters the long-term outlook: dogs with PSS but without microvascular dysplasia have a better long-term outlook for living free of symptoms and without medications.','The symptoms of PSS tend to emerge during puppyhood. These symptoms generally are associated with the central nervous system, the gastrointestinal tract, or the urinary tract. Most consistently, there are signs of hepatic encephalopathy - neurological and behavioural evidence of diffuse brain dysfunction due to liver dysfunction. Examples include loss of appetite, mental dullness, lethargy and sluggishness, weakness, poor balance, disorientation, blindness, seizures, and even coma. The symptoms may wax and wane, and may worsen after eating a protein-rich meal. With PSS, a pup''s growth may seem to be stunted or slower than the growth of littermates and age-mates. Indeed, "runts" of litters often turn out to be puppies that have birth defects, and PSS is a very common one of these. Failure of the liver to clear ammonia means that there will be increased excretion in the urine. This commonly leads to urolithiasis - kidney, bladder, or urethral calculi (stones) due to the build-up of mineral salts. Any young dog with urolithiasis (stones in the bladder, urethra, or kidneys) should be checked for PSS. The first sign of PSS in a dog may be a prolonged recovery from anesthesia, or excessive sedation after treatment with some medications. This occurs because with PSS, anesthetics and medications are not filtered out of the blood and broken down as they would normally be by the liver, but instead are recirculated in the body. The impact of PSS may not be apparent at first. Symptoms tend to worsen with age, and the decision to treat (via surgery) should be made as early as possible. Dogs do not outgrow PSS; surgery should be performed when a puppy is still growing, to minimize the risk of permanent damage. Dogs who are not candidates for surgery, either because they have a form of PSS that is inoperable or because surgery is not an option due to cost or availability, may still benefit from orally-administered medications at home. It is very important to realize that the final result of surgery for PSS can only be known weeks after the surgery has been done. The effects of PSS take time to subside, and the body''s ability to adapt back to normal after the surgical correction is different in every dog: many become totally normal and have normal lives, whereas some have irreversible damage associated with the PSS, and surgery only partially corrects these changes.',NULL,'Affected individuals and their parents should not be used for breeding.

The major goal of therapy is to reduce the loss of proteins into the intestine, to restore normal protein levels in your dog. This is done through diet, and medication to reduce inflammation in the intestinal wall. An ideal diet for dogs with protein-losing enteropathy contains minimal fat, and an ample quantity of high-quality protein. There are commercial prescription diets available which fulfill these requirements, or your veterinarian can give you information to prepare a low-fat diet at home.

INSERT INTO general_disease_annotate VALUES(405,'Tricuspid valve dysplasia','1345','Tricuspid valve dysplasia is a very uncommon heart condition in dogs.','Mild and even moderate cases of tricuspid dysplasia usually do not require any treatment at all. Mild exercise restriction may be wise, to reduce the strain on the tricuspid valve (which is at its worst during bursts of intense physical activity). Surgical replacement of the tricuspid valve is not feasible in dogs as it is in people; therefore, pre-emptive/early-stage treatment is not appropriate in the dog. Rather, dogs with tricuspid valve dysplasia should be observed at home for signs of abdominal enlargement or difficulty breathing. If such symptoms occur, then a recheck with the veterinarian is warranted, both to confirm that the symptoms are due to the heart (there are many noncardiac disorders that can mimic these symptoms) and to begin medication immediately if confirmed.','The veterinarian may detect a heart murmur long before an affected dog is showing any outwardly visible signs associated with tricuspid valve dysplasia. If a veterinarian detects a heart murmur and the murmur persists for more than 2-3 weeks, further investigation is always warranted. Tests can pinpoint tricuspid valve dysplasia as the problem and determine its degree of severity. Such tests generally include thoracic radiographs (X-rays of the chest) and an echocardiogram, also called sonogram of the heart, or cardiac ultrasound. Both are noninvasive procedures that can be performed awake or under mild sedation in virtually all dogs. The underlying problem (malformation of the tricuspid valve) as well as its impact (degree of distortion of surrounding heart chambers, for example) can be identified if present. This information helps determine whether treatment is necessary and whether the outlook is good, fair, or poor.','The main determinant of the impact of tricuspid dysplasia is the degree of valve malformation. Dogs with a mildly or even moderately malformed tricuspid valve routinely live normal lifespans. However, dogs with severe tricuspid valve malformations, even as pups, may develop symptoms of congestive heart failure, especially a bloated, pot-bellied appearance due to fluid pooling in the abdomen (ascites), difficulty breathing due to fluid retention in the chest cavity (pleural effusion), or both. Such severely affected dogs require medications to reduce the impact of the problem and maintain an acceptable quality of life.',NULL,'Affected individuals and their parents should not be used for breeding. Siblings should only be used after careful screening, and their offspring should be evaluated thoroughly (echocardiography). One obstacle to controlling tricuspid valve disease in the dog population in general and in specific breeds in particular is that overt symptoms are generally not evident until after a dog has reached breeding age. However, a heart murmur can often be detected long before the onset of symptoms. Breeders are encouraged to select mature rather than young dogs for breeding, and to use them only once they have been certified free of murmurs, preferably by a veterinary cardiologist (see www.acvim.org or www.ecvim-ca.org for directories of veterinary cardiologists in North America and Europe, respectively). There is widespread agreement regarding echocardiography (cardiac ultrasound) for dogs that have murmurs: only by having an echocardiogram is it possible to tell whether the murmur comes from tricuspid dysplasia or any of dozens of other defects, many of which are harmless. However, controversy exists regarding whether all Labrador dogs, with or without heart murmurs, should have an echocardiogram at some point in their lives prior to being used for breeding. The advantage is the opportunity to identify "silent" (no murmur) tricuspid dysplasia and reduce its transmission through the gene pool; the drawback is the time and cost needed to have an ecocardiogram performed.');

Larger ones may be removed surgically - this is necessary if the stone is blocking the ureter or a kidney, if your dog is in pain, or if the stones do not dissolve after a period of medical management.The medical approach is to dissolve the stones gradually by changing the pH of the urine, ie. making it more or less acidic (depending on the type of stone) through medication and changes in diet.Special diets also result in a larger volume of more dilute urine, making it easier for a dog to pass the stones. Your veterinarian will monitor your dog''s progress through periodic radiographs and analysis of the urine over the period of time the stones are dissolving (which can take some months). Some types of stones are more amenable to dissolution than others. In all cases of urolithiasis, in addition to paying careful attention to your dog''s diet, you can help to reduce the formation of stones by providing lots of fresh water and regular opportunities to urinate, so that urine doesn''t accumulate in the bladder allowing time for stones to form.

Identifying Arthritis in the early stages has the advantage of preventing further damage.','Some of the most prevalent symptoms of canine arthritis include pain, swelling of the joints, and inflammation. The first sign is often stiffness and decreased activity levels. As the disease progresses the dog’s gait can change as if the dog has had an injury. As the dog resists movement, muscle mass can decline from the lack of exercise. As the disease becomes more chronic, a dog parent may hear a crackling sound when the dog moves.When the arthritis is centered in the hip or legs, you will see the dog limp. The joint could be warm to the touch and the dog might react to the pain.

Osteoarthritis is usually seen in dog knees (stifles), shoulders, hips, elbows and the small joints of the spine.In all dog osteoarthritis cases there is an erosion in the cartilage that protects the ends of bones and keeps them from rubbing against each other when a joint moves. When the cartilage wears away, the bone ends come into contact. The grinding of bones causes joint pain and inflammation.

Some cases of CCD are severe and require medication to calm the compulsive urges enough to significantly improve the quality of life. Antidepressant medications are often effective for the management of CCD, however, they take several weeks to see any changes, and must be taken on a daily basis to remain active.','When you bring your pet into the veterinary clinic for behaviors related to canine compulsive disorder, the initial focus is on ruling out other medical causes. Symptoms consistent with this disorder can indicate other complications as well. Excessive licking and chewing of the skin, especially of the feet and joints, can also be indicative of allergies, a bacterial or fungal infection, or swelling in the joints. Other symptoms of CCD, such as compulsive circling, fly chasing, and inappropriate eating, can also be symptoms of neurological disorders as well, such as Cushing’s disease, canine cognitive disorder, and even brain tumors. Circling and pacing behaviors may also originate from disorders of the liver, particularly when accompanied by the dog pressing the top of their head against a hard surface. Head pressing is not a typical symptom of canine compulsive disorder and is almost always a sign of serious distress in your pet. A physical exam, blood tests, and imaging assessments are all utilized to make the definitive diagnosis.','Most of the behaviors exhibited by dogs with CCD are coping behaviors that in moderation may not be considered abnormal. Canines with CCD take these actions to extremes, such as licking or sucking on the skin until they damage their skin, or tail chewing on their tails during tail chasing. Compulsive behaviors that dogs exhibit can take several forms. The most frequent compulsive behaviors observed in dogs include: Air licking, Chewing or licking self, Eating inappropriate items (pica), Excessive eating or drinking, Flank sucking, Licking objects, Licking others,  Light or shadow chasing, Nose licking, Object sucking, Pacing ,Snapping at nonexistent flies, Spinning, Tail chasing','Canine compulsive disorder is often genetic at its core, although anxiety and stress can increase the likelihood of it developing.

Primary lens luxation is best treated with surgery as well; this is particularly crucial because of the pain it can cause your canine companion. In many cases, the surgeon will have to perform a complete removal of the eye, and sometimes a prosthetic one is used.

Collie eye anomaly may not progress, but there is the risk of retinal detachment and intraocular hemorrhage, while the latter, GPRA, may result in permanent blindness or cataract formation.','Glaucoma is diagnosed with an ophthalmic examination, a gonioscopy (to look at the eye between the iris and cornea), and tonometry (to determine intraocular pressure). Your veterinarian may see that your dog does not want to have his eye checked; this could be due to pain. Congestion in the eye and stretching of the globe could be apparent because of the intraocular pressure. Cataracts can be seen and diagnosed as the eye has a very visible cloudy, opaque appearance. Though congenital cataracts in very young dogs may reduce in size as the eye grows, cataracts that are causing complete blindness or have a risk of causing complications like leaking of lens material need to be addressed. General progressive retinal atrophy is accurately confirmed with a DNA test that has been developed. This is useful in that the testing can detect carriers and canines that are affected, and is important in breeding programs of predisposed breeds. Collie eye anomaly will be diagnosed by an ophthalmoscopy which allows for a view of the interior of the eyeball. It can indicate if there are pieces of the eye missing, or if tissue damage is apparent that can lead to retinal detachment.

This is accomplished by reducing the entry, production and absorption of gastrointestinal toxins and by administering systemic drugs to counteract their harmful effects. The mainstays of therapy for encephalopathy involves reduction of protein intake, and suppression or elimination of urease-producing intestinal bacteria. In addition, steps must be taken to recognize and eliminate any factors which may have induced the encephalopathy. For animals with signs of encephalopathy, all oral intake of food should cease until CNS signs abate. This is particularly important for protein. Cessation of food intake eliminates dietary sources of ammonia, toxic amines, aromatic amino acids, and short chain fatty acids which induce encephalopathy. Additional supportive measures may be necessary in the management of animals with this condition. In patients with hepatic failure, parenteral fluid therapy is often required for several days.The current thinking is that although ammonia is the major culprit responsible for the hepatic encephalopathy, the presence of local and systemic inflammation and the release of reactive oxygen species (free radicals) further exacerbate the cerebral effects of ammonia.

In the case that it’s too late for either procedure, if the hernia is reducible, then it can simply be pushed back into its correct area (example: abdominal wall). Oral antacid preparation, along with medical treatment, may also be used to treat hernias in nonlife-threatening cases. In both cases, the earlier a hernia can be detected, the higher likelihood that this can be done. Nonreducible hernias are linked to incidents where body tissue may have grown together due to swelling or blocked in so much that it cannot easily be pushed back. If the hernia has escalated to a strangulated hernia, when blood supply is lost, surgery is a mandatory procedure. Surgery is also necessary to prevent tissue from attaching itself to other organs. Male dogs may have the upper hand on inguinal hernias near the rear legs. Sometimes small inguinal hernias will close without medical attention, including with male pups. With female dogs, especially ones who are pregnant, this is not usually the case, and medical attention will be needed. In the case of a hiatal hernia combined with pneumonia, it is imperative that pet owners follow antibiotic prescription instructions from veterinarians, along with any dietary needs.','The veterinarian will first inquire about whether the dog has already been spayed or neutered. If not, this will be recommended in addition to finding out the area where the hernia is located via X-rays. Contrast studies, which are completed orally or by needle injection, confirm the diagnosis before proceeding with treatment. The contrast study will highlight where the hernia is on X-ray film or digitally, depending on available equipment. Considering hernias consist of tissue moving into the wrong place; veterinarians will be on the lookout for what doesn’t look quite right in certain regions of the body. The veterinarian will also look for any signs of respiratory or abdominal disorders, as well as hard or painful bulges. Because those hard bulges could lead to fatalities if bacteria is able to travel through the muscle tissue, those areas will be focused on immediately before moving onto any other possible hernia areas.','Pet owners will usually notice signs of hernias in their dogs due to: Food and/or water vomiting; Loss of appetite (although water may still be attractive to them) Physical signs include: Cramping ;Fever ;Leg numbness ;Lethargy ;Swelling (noticeable when the dog barks, cries, stands or strains) In the worst case scenarios, a dog may die if bacterial toxins are able to make their way into a dog''s body after tissues break down.

Drugs that may be used include diuretics that cause the dog to urinate more and thereby remove excess fluids from his lungs. These include furosemide (Lasix) or spironolactone .','The first indication that there may be a problem with the mitral valve is a heart murmur. Your veterinarian can detect the heart murmur when listening to your dog''s heart with a stethoscope. Many dogs may have a heart murmur but no signs of any heart problem. If your veterinarian hears a murmur, the next step is to generally do radiographs (x-rays) to determine if the size of the heart has increased due to the increased workload on the heart. Monitoring the size of the heart is the best way to determine how quickly the disease may be progressing. Special testing called ''echocardiography'' can be performed to actually visualize the mitral valve and detect insufficiency.','The result of mitral insufficiency is elevated blood pressure within both the lung field and right side of the heart. The symptoms caused by this condition are very predictable. When hypertension (higher than normal blood pressure) occurs within the lungs, fluid actually leaves the blood vessels and leaks into the tissues. The medical term used to describe ''fluid in the lungs'' is ''pulmonary edema.'' This causes the affected individual to have difficulty breathing and cough in an attempt to clear the lungs of the fluid, just as you would do with a chest cold. The cough that typically occurs after exercise, excitement, or when the animal has first gotten up after sleeping is often the first clinical symptom noted with mitral insufficiency.As the condition progresses, the right side of the heart starts to fail because of its increased work and elevated pressures. At first the muscles strengthen, thereby increasing the mass and thickness of its walls. Over time, however, even these ''athletic'' muscles cannot keep up with the ever-increasing pressures and they start to fail. During this congestive heart failure, the animal will be weaker and tire more easily, and may even faint. The dog may also lose weight and appear pale.

Often the extra toe on the hind limb is situated higher than the other toes and doesn’t come into contact with the ground when your puppy or dog runs and plays. This extra toe is often called a dewclaw. It is only considered a problem if the nail on that toe is not clipped often enough and starts being caught on things when your dog moves. If this happens, your dog can either be injured by being caught and stopped suddenly, or the toes suffers tearing from the limb causing muscular damage. Keeping the extra toes trimmed can avoid this from happening.','Most breeds of dogs have four main toes and one dew claw on the front limbs, with four toes on the back.

Often just considered an unremarkable trait, it is not really a problem unless it hinders other toes or the leg of your dog. The polydactyly digit is usually located up higher on the leg from the other toes. There are two types of polydactyly in dogs, those that are bred intentionally to exhibit this trait while in others it is the result of a rare autosomal recessive genetic condition that results in the extra toes.The Norwegian Lundehund is a small dog that is a true polydactyly with six toes (instead of the usual four) with all of them fully formed, jointed and muscled; this dog is adapted to climb narrow cliff paths in Vaeroy where it originally hunted the Puffin bird.With breeds of dogs that work on snow or uneven ground it is considered an advantage to have extra toes.','In both dogs and cats, limb formation occurs from the 23rd day of gestation and is an intricate process which involves the formation of the limb bud, limb elongation, and the formation of the toes, bone and joints.

X-rays are often taken to assess the spine and pelvis and while such scans can show narrowing of the spinal column this is not always enough to diagnose symptomatic spinal stenosis as some narrowing is common but may not cause symptoms.Dogs may undergo a myelograph, epidurograph, or discograph, where radioactive material is injected into the spinal column, epidural space or disc space before x-ray in order to determine any abnormalities in the anatomy as shown by the displacement of the radioactive dye.','Symptoms of spinal stenosis in dogs can include changes in bowel and bladder function, leading to incontinence, as well as poor mobility, increased fatigue and reluctance to go on walks, hikes, or to play as before, and obvious pain and discomfort, especially when touched on the hind legs, back or tail. The most common symptom of lumbosacral stenosis in dogs is difficult standing after lying down, which can worsen as the muscles in the hind legs atrophy through reduced nerve stimulation and use.Dogs with cauda equina syndrome may have such severe pain that this causes them to urinate or defecate involuntarily. Some dogs develop severe pain in their tail and may stop wagging their tail as before. Dogs may also develop a shuffling walk, scuffing their toes and perhaps tripping. When pain is chronic it may lead a dog to chew at their back legs, tail, and/or pelvic region. Some dogs cause themselves serious damage to the skin and fur in these areas through obsessive chewing due to pain.','Some breeds of dog, such as German Shepherds and other large breeds, and the dachshund and beagle are more likely to develop degnerative disc disease than other breeds.
